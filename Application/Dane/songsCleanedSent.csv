Renting out your mind
And saving every dime
Because when ten of those combine
They cross a sacred line
And go from pocket change
To a gold mine

She said she'd be down to hangout
With her parents out of town she was hoping I'm around
For a party at her vacant place
I said I'd come; showed up and felt out of place
So I headed home

That's when she text my phone and ask me where
I was and when I said I was gone
She broke my spine
And in that pain
I realized that every dime I'd ever saved wasn't worth anything

What's the drive in being alive when you don't know who you are?
What's the fun in getting drunk if you can?t take it too far
Yeah my friends are saying I?ve been wasting all my weekends contemplating
If it's me or the booze that really gets wasted
I don?t even taste it
When I?m throwing back shots as if its a race then
Quickly chase them

I'm gettin' away by hitting the road
Somehow she make it to all of my shows now where can I go

Girl it's a simple a matter
Put your painted finger on my tongue
So I can taste the lacquer
And relive each door that you have touched

And then she split my lips
And for three whole days
I tried to speak but everyone agreed
They couldn't hear a word I'd say

What's the drive in being alive when you don't know who you are?
What's the fun in getting drunk if you can't take it too far
I'm singing oh I don't know
Take me anywhere but home

Without a mouth I'm so down
But my hometown only makes me feel alone
Then just when I I I I think I'm in the clear she hook her hair behind her ears and says I'm
Going down
She said baby it's okay to feel the way you do if you keep it to yourself

Life is a bitch with no mouth and no lips
But it sure ain't no fun with no teeth and no tongue

I'm nice right now
I-I feel good

Would you please put it in the air

That party last night
Was awfully crazy, I wish we taped it
I danced my ass off
And had this one girl completely naked
Drink my drink and smoke my weed
But my good friends is all I need
Pass out at three, wake up at ten
Go out to eat, then do it again
Man, I love college

[Verse 1]
I wanna go to college for the rest of my life
Sip Bankers Club, and drink Miller Lite
On Thirsty Thursday and Tuesday Night Ice
And I can get pizza a dollar a slice
So fill up my cup, let's get fucked up (Let's get fucked up!)
I'm next on the table, who want what
I am champion, at beer pong
Allen Iverson, Hakeem Olajuwon
Don't even bounce, not in my house
Better hope you make it, otherwise you naked
Time isn't wasted, when you're getting wasted
Woke up today, and all I could say is, um

Man I love college (Hey!)
And I love drinking (Hey!)
I love women (Hey!)
Man I love college (Hey!)

[Verse 2]
I can't tell you what I learned from school
But, I could tell you a story or two
Um yea, of course I learned some rules
Like don't pass out with your shoes on
And don't leave the house, 'til the booze gone
And don't have sex, if she's too gone
When it comes to condoms put two on
Then tomorrow night, find a new jawn
Hold the beer bong, nothing wrong with some fun
Even if we did get a little bit too drunk
Time isn't wasted, when you're getting wasted
Woke up today, and all I could say is

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I'm so appalled, Spalding ball
Balding Donald Trump taking dollars from y'all
Baby, you're fired, your girlfriend hired
But if you don't mind, I'ma keep you on call
We above the law, we don't give a fuck about y'all
I got dogs that'll chew a fucking hole through the wall
But since they all lovers, I need more rubbers
And if I don't use rubbers, need more covers
Housekeeping, I mean goddamn
One time let it be a bad bitch sweeping
That know we get O's like Cheerios
That know because they seen us in the videos
That know the day that you play me
Would be the same day MTV play videos
That was a little joke, voila
Praises due to the most high, Allah
Praises due to the most fly, Prada
Baby, I'm magic, tada
Address me as your highness, high as United
30,000 feet up and you are not invited
Niggas be writing bullshit like they gotta work
Niggas is going through real shit, man, they out of work
That's why another goddamn dance track gotta hurt
That's why I'd rather spit something that got a purp'

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
How should I begin this? I'm just so offended
How am I even mentioned by all these fucking beginners?
I'm so appalled, I might buy the mall
Just to show niggas how much more I have in store
I'm fresher than you all, so I don't have to pause
All of y'all can suck my balls through my drawers
Dark Knight feeling, die and be a hero
Or live long enough to see yourself become a villain
I went from the favorite to the most hated
But would you rather be underpaid or overrated?
Moral victories is for minor league coaches
And 'Ye already told you we major, you cockroaches
Show me where the boats is, Ferrari Testarossas
And Hammer went broke so you know I'm more focused
I lost thirty mil, so I spent another thirty
'Cause unlike Hammer, thirty million can't hurt me
Fucking insane, the fuck am I saying?
Not only am I fly, I'm fucking not playing
All these little bitches too big for they britches

Success is what you make it, take it how it come
A half a mil in twenties like a billion where I'm from
An arrogant drug dealer, the legend I become
CNN said I'd be dead by twenty-one
Blackjack, I just pulled an ace
As you looking at the king in his face
Everything I dream, motherfuckers, I'm watching it take shape
While to you I'm just a young rich nigga that lacks faith
Range Rove, leather roof, love war, fuck a truce
Still move a bird like I'm in bed with Mother Goose
Them hoes coming in a baker's dozen
Claiming they was with me when they know they really wasn't
I keep the city's best, never said she was the brightest
So if you had her too, it don't affect me in the slightest
I never met a bitch that didn't need a little guidance
So I dismiss her past until she disappoints your highness
I speak the gospel, hostile
Tony doing time for what he did to nostrils
Paranoid mind, I'm still under the watchful
Eye of the law, aspire for more
Them kilos came, we gave you Bobby Brown jaw
Flaws ain't flaws when it's you that makes the call
Flow similar to the legends of the falls
Spill it, I own you all, yeah

[Verse 4: CyHi The Prynce]
Hah, I am so outrageous
I wear my pride on my sleeve like a bracelet
If God had an iPod, I'd be on his playlist
My phrases amazes the faces in places
The favorite, hah, my cup overrunneth with hundreds
Dummy, damn, it's hard not for me to waste it
The new Commandment: ""Thou shalt not hate, kid""
My movement is like the civil rights, I'm Ralph David
Abernathy, so call my lady Rosa Parks
I am nothing like them niggas, baby, those are marks
I met this girl on Valentine's Day, fucked her in May
She found out about April, so she chose to march
Hah, damn another broken heart
I keep bitches by the twos, nigga, Noah's ark
I got a seven on me, I call my 'dro Lamar
Plus a Trojan in my pocket, Matt Leinart
G-A-T in the Pathfinder
Cause you haters got PhDs

But to provide for mine who ask

Everything dandy, gray sweats with the Pennys

Well, she's got a hottie's body but her attitude is potty
When I met her at a party, she was hardly acting naughty
I said ""Shorty, would you call me?""
She said, ""Pardon me, are you balling?""
I said ""Darling, you sound like a prostitute pausing""
Oh, so you're one them freaks
Get geeked at the sight of an ATM receipt
But game been peeped, dropping names she's weak
Tricking off this bitch is lost, must take me for a geek
A quick way to eat, a neat place sleep
A rent-a-car for a week, a trick for a treat
No go on the raw sex, my AIDS test is flawless
Regardless we don't want to get involved with all them lawyers
And judges just to hold grudges in a courtroom
I wanna see your support bra, not support you

Down avenues that reek of time to kill

You better make up something quick

Only time I'm in crowed, they both tell
They can say it was vacuum sealed with no smell
I was sitting in jail with no bail
I was sitting in prison getting no mail
My nigga switching up on me I don?t care
They got jack shit on him he won't tell
ZO6 Vette, ridin' the fast lane, hope I don't wreck
I'm on that red
Pourin it up with most disrespect
Forgiato on my cars now
I been fuckin 'round with the stars now

Give these niggas a chance but they time us
Switch the hustle, I did get the grind up
In the spot hundred dollars the lineup
Only big homie niggas can line us
Stickin dick in this bitch cause she fine as fuck

Now I'm trapped in a melting pot

I turned my heart into a stowaway
And can't erase all my old ways

I can never follow the mature way
Maybe that's the reason why I'm lonely

Running out of funds, need some more love
Maybe I should gun for the throne

Once upon a younger year
When all our shadows disappeared
The animals inside came out to play
Hey, went face to face with all our fears
Learned our lessons through the tears
Make memories we knew would never fade

Son, don't let it slip away
He took me in his arms, I heard him say
When you get older
Your wild heart will live for younger days

When thunder clouds start pouring down
Light a fire they can't put out

Son of a gun

[Verse 1]
You walked into the party
Like you were walking onto a yacht
Your hat strategically dipped below one eye
Your scarf it was apricot
You had one eye in the mirror
As you watched yourself gavotte
And all the girls dreamed that they'd be your partner
They'd be your partner

You're so vain

You had me several years ago
When I was still quite naive
Well, you said that we made such a pretty pair
And that you would never leave
But you gave away the things you loved
And one of them was me
I had some dreams they were clouds in my coffee
Clouds in my coffee, and

Don't you? Don't you?

[Verse 3]
Well, I hear you went up to Saratoga
And your horse naturally won
Then you flew your Lear jet up to Nova Scotia
To see the total eclipse of the sun
Well, you're where you should be all the time
And when you're not, you're with
Some underworld spy or the wife of a close friend
Wife of a close friend, and

I think about her with her clothes off

I introduced her to this hippy life
We make love under pretty lights, LSD (Acid)
I get a feelin' it's a trippy night
Them other drugs just don't fit me right

Make no mistakes, it's all, a leap of faith for love

I thought that home is where you are until that home is where I left
I found a home inside myself since no home for me was left
I slept with poems in my hands for seven days
Slept alone and wept by twilight so I thrown aside a phone in heaven's name

Cause home can change and it does
Corny names for new love
Joining strange depictions tinted with that rose from my bud
Cause blood is thick but smoke be thick as hell
Eyes all on my mind my shell in shell shock
With lonely mail all cluttered on my desktop

Used to got the best box and cutter slice and dice with sideway stump
Stutter with that t-t-tongue
I scream gently how'd you undo us
For goodness sake you make me undone

These poems underneath my nails
Sweat makes the ink run
Smolder-heavy memory brain showed her a pink love

Heavy multi-memory brain shed in a pink tongue

I heard we're changing lanes
I heard he likes to race
I heard that six or seven words he likes to use
Are always in bad taste
And I heard that Monday's just a word we say
Every seven times around
And then we pin the tail on Tuesday
Watch those strings go up and down
The elephant in the room begins to dance
The cameras zoom into
His mouth begins to move
Those hateful words he uses

Divided into reasons why

The residue from the price tag
On the tip of my tongue
The words don't come they go
How many likes I gotta get
Before I know the truth
And the truth is
Season three will be a great reason
To forget all about reality's
A slippery slope
Watch the TV scream and shout it

Deserve anything
As if its balanced in the end
And the good guys always win

I've been gone awhile away from you
And I hope you overstand
That I've got to do what I must do to be a better man
Cause if I was just to act a fool do nothing with myself
Then all my blessings would be cursed my world would crumble in
It's a joy when I sit down and think of the good times that we have
And what we do to make it through when the good turns to the bad
Well I hope you find it in your heart and know these words are true
And please don't fuss because I must go do what I must do

I'll be coming home to you again
And if you thought that I was lost, I have to bear my cross
Now I'm free from all these chains

[Verse 2: Stephen Marley]
A time, a space, a different place, how perfect we might be
I would be the wind that blows you'd be that willow tree
And I could never bare the thought of you not by my side
So I would be the warmth of day you'd be the cool of night
And everyday I pray to Jah that one day you will see
And overstand the fact I must fulfill my destiny
I hope you find it in your heart and know these words are true
And please don't cry you know I must do what I must do

And God knows, that life is one big road
With a lot of signs and turns and twist and curves
Even though the road is rocky

And we, be seein the sites standin under the lights
And the spot is hot it's cold and lonely at nights
And I'm feenin and I'm dreamin and I'm holdin you tight
But hold on, every single road I rode on
Come to an end and I'm back home again
So baby please don't cry
It's no valley low and it's no mountain high
And our love don't die with the passage of time
It just grow more, it just keep strong
And even though I'm gone I ain't never too far
Your the light through the dark shining right through my heart
So my journey just start

[Verse 1]
Chemistry was crazy from the get go
Neither one of us knew why
We didn?t build nothin? overnight
Cause a love like this takes some time
People swore it off as a phase, said we can?t see that
Now from top to bottom, they see that we did that
(Yes) it?s so true that
(Yes) we been through it
(Yes) we got real shit
(Yes) see baby we've been...

And I?ll be waitin? up until you get home
Cause I can?t sleep without you baby

Too hard to fake it, nothin? can replace it
Call the radio if you just can?t be without your baby

[Verse 2]
I got a question for ya (see I already know the answer)
Still I wanna ask you will you lie? (No)
Make me cry? (No)
Do somethin? behind my back and then try to cover it up
Well neither would I, baby
My love is only your love
(Yes) I?ll be faithful
(Yes) I?m for real
And with us you?ll always know the deal

[Verse 1: T-Boz]
Every now and then I get a little crazy
That's not the way it's supposed to be
Sometimes my vision is a little hazy
I can't tell who I should trust or just who I let trust me, yeah
People try to say I act a little funny
But that's just a figure of speech to me
They tell me I changed because I got money
But if you were there before then you're still down with me, yeah

What about your friends
Will they stand their ground
Will they let you down again
What about your friends
Are they gonna be low down
Will they ever be around
Or will they turn their backs on you

[Refrain: Left Eye]
Well is it me or can it be I'm a little too
Friendly so to speak hypothetically say
I supply creativity to what others
Must take as a form of self-hate
Only to make an enemy
Which results in unfortunate destiny
They dog me out then be next to me
Just cause I am what some choose to envy

[Verse 2: T-Boz]
Every now and then I get a little easy
I let a lot of people depend on me
I never thought they would ever deceive me
Don't you know when times got rough
I was standing on my own
I'll never let another get that close to me
You see I've grown a lot smarter now
Sometimes you have to choose and then you'll see
If your friend is true they'll be there with you
Through the thick and thin

What about your friends (What about your friends)

Will they let you down again (let you down again)

Yo is it me, here we go

I wouldn't change not for no money
I'll be a friend as long as you're a friend to me yeah yeah (What about your friends)

It don't give you no cause to deceive me
It's not the way that I want my friends to ever be

Blinking in the morning sun
Shaking off the heavy one
Heavy like a loaded gun

But the fall looks very far

Will do to me too
Be free and on your own

Caught in my weather every time

I hear the clock, it's six A.M
I feel so far from where I've been
I got my eggs, I got my pancakes too
I got my maple syrup, everything but you
I break the yolks and make a smiley face
I kinda like it in my brand new place
Wipe the spots up off the mirror
Don't leave the keys in the door
I never put wet towels on the floor anymore 'cause...

I know that you love me
And soon you will see

And I was meant for you

[Verse 2]
I called my momma, she was out for a walk
Consoled a cup of coffee but it didn't wanna talk
So I picked up the paper, it was more bad news
More hearts being broken or people being used
Put on my coat in the pouring rain
I saw a movie and it just wasn't the same
Cause it was happy or I was sad
And it made me miss you oh so bad 'cause...

Besides what would I say if I had you on the line?
Same old story, not much to say
Hearts are broken, everyday

[Verse 3]
I brush my teeth, I put the cap back on
I know you hate it when I leave the light on
I pick a book up and then I turn the sheets down
And then I take a deep breath and a good look around
Put on my pj's and hop into bed
I'm half alive but I feel mostly dead
I try and tell myself it'll all be alright
I just shouldn't think anymore tonight 'cause...

Gloomy on sunny days, shadows no house or trees
Prayers not close to me as I bow down and take a knee
Hell goes far as the eye can see, hoodies and weaponry
Naive to being free, locked up, we chasing keys
How your eyes investigate us, while we look up to entertainers
Ball players, pistol bangers, big brothers, uncles, uncles
Betrayed by a lot of homies, all my friendships stay on shuffle
Huddles, steady find a plan, spread evil beyond the land
As I clench down upon this trigger, the burn fucking burn
Every step to getting deeper, survival my main concern
Marinating in Satan's sweat, take a sip of this holy water
Hoping God still keep me blessed, with a dark shield for my armor

Promises, man, I promised, none of them goals accomplished
Promises, man, I promised to be loyal and honest
Promises, man, I promised, lied on separate occasions
Promises, man, I promised, my promises is aging
Hennessy what my system like, feeling like Superman
I might crip tonight, I bring loss to life
A gruesome site, look who don' got involved
It's no different from wars, it's kill or be called upon
Feeling teary eyed, thinking I've gone too far
Ask God for forgiveness, shit I doubt he heard me at all
They say clean your hands before you eat, rinse your sins with prayer
But I've done did some things I don't think I could ever wash away

In the beginning there was only chaos. Then out of the void appeared Erebus, the unknowable place where death dwells, and Night. All else was empty, silent, endless, darkness. Then somehow Love was born bringing a start of order. From Love came Light and Day. Once there was Light and Day, Gaea, the earth appeared.

Then Erebus slept with Night, who gave birth to Ether, the heavenly light, and to Day the earthly light. Then Night alone produced Doom, Fate, Death, Sleep, Dreams, Nemesis, and others that come to man out of darkness.

Meanwhile Gaea alone gave birth to Uranus, the heavens. Uranus became Gaea's mate covering her on all sides. Together they produced the three Cyclopes, the three Hecatoncheires, and twelve Titans.

However, Uranus was a bad father and husband. He hated the Hecatoncheires. He imprisoned them by pushing them into the hidden places of the earth, Gaea's womb. This angered Gaea and she plotted against Uranus. She made a flint sickle and tried to get her children to attack Uranus. All were too afraid except, the youngest Titan, Cronus.

Gaea and Cronus set up an ambush of Uranus as he lay with Gaea at night. Cronus grabbed his father and castrated him, with the stone sickle, throwing the severed genitals into the ocean. The fate of Uranus is not clear. He either died, withdrew from the earth, or exiled himself to Italy. As he departed he promised that Cronus and the Titans would be punished. From his spilt blood came the Giants, the Ash Tree Nymphs, and the Erinnyes. From the sea foam where his genitals fell came Aphrodite.

Cronus became the next ruler. He imprisoned the Cyclopes and the Hecatoncheires in Tartarus. He married his sister Rhea, under his rule the Titans had many offspring. He ruled for many ages. However, Gaea and Uranus both had prophesied that he would be overthrown by a son. To avoid this Cronus swallowed each of his children as they were born. Rhea was angry at the treatment of the children and plotted against Cronus. When it came time to give birth to her sixth child, Rhea hid herself, then she left the child to be raised by nymphs. To conceal her act she wrapped a stone in swaddling cloths and passed it off as the baby to Cronus, who swallowed it.

This child was Zeus. He grew into a handsome youth on Crete. He consulted Metis on how to defeat Cronus. She prepared a drink for Cronus design to make him vomit up the other children. Rhea convinced Cronus to accept his son and Zeus was allowed to return to Mount Olympus as Cronus's cupbearer. This gave Zeus the opportunity to slip Cronus the specially prepared drink. This worked as planned and the other five children were vomited up. Being gods they were unharmed. They were thankful to Zeus and made him their leader.

Cronus was yet to be defeated. He and the Titans, except Prometheus, Epimetheus, and Oceanus, fought to retain their power. Atlas became their leader in battle and it looked for some time as though they would win and put the young gods down. However, Zeus was cunning. He went down to Tartarus and freed the Cyclopes and the Hecatoncheires. Prometheus joined Zeus as well. He returned to battle with his new allies. The Cyclopes provided Zeus with lighting bolts for weapons. The Hecatoncheires he set in ambush armed with boulders. With the time right, Zeus retreated drawing the Titans into the Hecatoncheires's ambush. The Hecatoncheires rained down hundreds of boulders with such a fury the Titans thought the mountains were falling on them. They broke and ran giving Zeus victory.

Zeus exiled the Titans who had fought against him into Tartarus. Except for Atlas, who was singled out for the special punishment of holding the world on his shoulders.

However, even after this victory Zeus was not safe. Gaea angry that her children had been imprisoned gave birth to a last offspring, Typhoeus. Typhoeus was so fearsome that most of the gods fled. However, Zeus faced the monster and flinging his lighting bolts was able to kill it. Typhoeus was buried under Mount Etna in Sicily.

Much later a final challenge to Zeus rule was made by the Giants. They went so far as to attempt to invade Mount Olympus, piling mountain upon mountain in an effort to reach the top. But, the gods had grown strong and with the help of Heracles the Giants were subdued or killed.






Genesis 1

(1-2) First this: God created the Heavens and Earth?all you see, all you don?t see. Earth was a soup of nothingness, a bottomless emptiness, an inky blackness. God?s Spirit brooded like a bird above the watery abyss.

(3-5) God spoke: ?Light!?
And light appeared.
God saw that light was good
and separated light from dark.
God named the light Day,
he named the dark Night.
It was evening, it was morning?
Day One.

(6-8) God spoke: ?Sky! In the middle of the waters;
separate water from water!?
God made sky.
He separated the water under sky
from the water above sky.
And there it was:
he named sky the Heavens;
It was evening, it was morning?
Day Two.

(9-10) God spoke: ?Separate!
Water-beneath-Heaven, gather into one place;
Land, appear!?
And there it was.
God named the land Earth.
He named the pooled water Ocean.
God saw that it was good.

(11-13) God spoke: ?Earth, green up! Grow all varieties
of seed-bearing plants,
Every sort of fruit-bearing tree.?
And there it was.
Earth produced green seed-bearing plants,
all varieties,
And fruit-bearing trees of all sorts.
God saw that it was good.
It was evening, it was morning?
Day Three.

(14-15) God spoke: ?Lights! Come out!
Shine in Heaven?s sky!
Separate Day from Night.
Mark seasons and days and years,
Lights in Heaven?s sky to give light to Earth.?
And there it was.

(16-19) God made two big lights, the larger
to take charge of Day,
The smaller to be in charge of Night;
and he made the stars.
God placed them in the heavenly sky
to light up Earth
And oversee Day and Night,
to separate light and dark.
God saw that it was good.
It was evening, it was morning?
Day Four.

(20-23) God spoke: ?Swarm, Ocean, with fish and all sea life!
Birds, fly through the sky over Earth!?
God created the huge whales,
all the swarm of life in the waters,
And every kind and species of flying birds.
God saw that it was good.
God blessed them: ?Prosper! Reproduce! Fill Ocean!
Birds, reproduce on Earth!?
It was evening, it was morning?
Day Five.

(24-25) God spoke: ?Earth, generate life! Every sort and kind:
cattle and reptiles and wild animals?all kinds.?
And there it was:
wild animals of every kind,
Cattle of all kinds, every sort of reptile and bug.
God saw that it was good.

(26-28) God spoke: ?Let us make human beings in our image, make them
reflecting our nature
So they can be responsible for the fish in the sea,
the birds in the air, the cattle,
And, yes, Earth itself,
and every animal that moves on the face of Earth.?
God created human beings;
he created them godlike,
Reflecting God?s nature.
He created them male and female.
God blessed them:
?Prosper! Reproduce! Fill Earth! Take charge!
Be responsible for fish in the sea and birds in the air,
for every living thing that moves on the face of Earth.?

(29-30) Then God said, ?I?ve given you
every sort of seed-bearing plant on Earth
And every kind of fruit-bearing tree,
given them to you for food.
To all animals and all birds,
everything that moves and breathes,
I give whatever grows out of the ground for food.?
And there it was.

(31) God looked over everything he had made;
it was so good, so very good!
It was evening, it was morning?
Day Six.

Genesis 2
(1) Heaven and Earth were finished,
down to the last detail.

(2-4) By the seventh day
God had finished his work.
On the seventh day
he rested from all his work.
God blessed the seventh day.
He made it a Holy Day
Because on that day he rested from his work,
all the creating God had done.
This is the story of how it all started,
of Heaven and Earth when they were created.

(5-7) At the time God made Earth and Heaven, before any grasses or shrubs had sprouted from the ground?God hadn?t yet sent rain on Earth, nor was there anyone around to work the ground (the whole Earth was watered by underground springs)?God formed Man out of dirt from the ground and blew into his nostrils the breath of life. The Man came alive?a living soul!

(8-9) Then God planted a garden in Eden, in the east. He put the Man he had just made in it. God made all kinds of trees grow from the ground, trees beautiful to look at and good to eat. The Tree-of-Life was in the middle of the garden, also the Tree-of-Knowledge-of-Good-and-Evil.

(10-14) A river flows out of Eden to water the garden and from there divides into four rivers. The first is named Pishon; it flows through Havilah where there is gold. The gold of this land is good. The land is also known for a sweet-scented resin and the onyx stone. The second river is named Gihon; it flows through the land of Cush. The third river is named Hiddekel and flows east of Assyria. The fourth river is the Euphrates.

(15) God took the Man and set him down in the Garden of Eden to work the ground and keep it in order.

(16-17) God commanded the Man, ?You can eat from any tree in the garden, except from the Tree-of-Knowledge-of-Good-and-Evil. Don?t eat from it. The moment you eat from that tree, you?re dead.?

(18-20) God said, ?It?s not good for the Man to be alone; I?ll make him a helper, a companion.? So God formed from the dirt of the ground all the animals of the field and all the birds of the air. He brought them to the Man to see what he would name them. Whatever the Man called each living creature, that was its name. The Man named the cattle, named the birds of the air, named the wild animals; but he didn?t find a suitable companion.

(21-22) God put the Man into a deep sleep. As he slept he removed one of his ribs and replaced it with flesh. God then used the rib that he had taken from the Man to make Woman and presented her to the Man.

(23-25)
The Man said,
?Finally! Bone of my bone,
flesh of my flesh!
Name her Woman
for she was made from Man.?
Therefore a man leaves his father and mother and embraces his wife. They become one flesh.
The two of them, the Man and his Wife, were naked, but they felt no shame.

Genesis 3
(1) The serpent was clever, more clever than any wild animal God had made. He spoke to the Woman: ?Do I understand that God told you not to eat from any tree in the garden??

(2-3) The Woman said to the serpent, ?Not at all. We can eat from the trees in the garden. It?s only about the tree in the middle of the garden that God said, ?Don?t eat from it; don?t even touch it or you?ll die.??

(4-5) The serpent told the Woman, ?You won?t die. God knows that the moment you eat from that tree, you?ll see what?s really going on. You?ll be just like God, knowing everything, ranging all the way from good to evil.?

(6) When the Woman saw that the tree looked like good eating and realized what she would get out of it?she?d know everything!?she took and ate the fruit and then gave some to her husband, and he ate.

(7) Immediately the two of them did ?see what?s really going on??saw themselves naked! They sewed fig leaves together as makeshift clothes for themselves.

(8) When they heard the sound of God strolling in the garden in the evening breeze, the Man and his Wife hid in the trees of the garden, hid from God.

(9) God called to the Man: ?Where are you??

(10) He said, ?I heard you in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked. And I hid.?

(11) God said, ?Who told you you were naked? Did you eat from that tree I told you not to eat from??

(12) The Man said, ?The Woman you gave me as a companion, she gave me fruit from the tree, and, yes, I ate it.?

God said to the Woman, ?What is this that you?ve done??

(13) ?The serpent seduced me,? she said, ?and I ate.?

(14-15) God told the serpent:

?Because you?ve done this, you?re cursed,
cursed beyond all cattle and wild animals,
Cursed to slink on your belly
and eat dirt all your life.
I?m declaring war between you and the Woman,
between your offspring and hers.
He?ll wound your head,
you?ll wound his heel.?

(16) He told the Woman:

?I?ll multiply your pains in childbirth;
you?ll give birth to your babies in pain.
You?ll want to please your husband,
but he?ll lord it over you.?

(17-19) He told the Man:

?Because you listened to your wife
and ate from the tree
That I commanded you not to eat from,
?Don?t eat from this tree,?
The very ground is cursed because of you;
getting food from the ground
Will be as painful as having babies is for your wife;
you?ll be working in pain all your life long.
The ground will sprout thorns and weeds,
you?ll get your food the hard way,
Planting and tilling and harvesting,
sweating in the fields from dawn to dusk,
Until you return to that ground yourself, dead and buried;
you started out as dirt, you?ll end up dirt.?

(20) The Man, known as Adam, named his wife Eve because she was the mother of all the living.

(21) God made leather clothing for Adam and his wife and dressed them.

(22) God said, ?The Man has become like one of us, capable of knowing everything, ranging from good to evil. What if he now should reach out and take fruit from the Tree-of-Life and eat, and live forever? Never?this cannot happen!?

(23-24) So God expelled them from the Garden of Eden and sent them to work the ground, the same dirt out of which they?d been made. He threw them out of the garden and stationed angel-cherubim and a revolving sword of fire east of it, guarding the path to the Tree-of-Life.

Genesis 4
(1) Adam slept with Eve his wife. She conceived and had Cain. She said, ?I?ve gotten a man, with God?s help!?

(2) Then she had another baby, Abel. Abel was a herdsman and Cain a farmer.

(3-5) Time passed. Cain brought an offering to God from the produce of his farm. Abel also brought an offering, but from the firstborn animals of his herd, choice cuts of meat. God liked Abel and his offering, but Cain and his offering didn?t get his approval. Cain lost his temper and went into a sulk.

(6-7) God spoke to Cain: ?Why this tantrum? Why the sulking? If you do well, won?t you be accepted? And if you don?t do well, sin is lying in wait for you, ready to pounce; it?s out to get you, you?ve got to master it.?

(8) Cain had words with his brother. They were out in the field; Cain came at Abel his brother and killed him.

(9) God said to Cain, ?Where is Abel your brother??

He said, ?How should I know? Am I his babysitter??

(10-12) God said, ?What have you done! The voice of your brother?s blood is calling to me from the ground. From now on you?ll get nothing but curses from this ground; you?ll be driven from this ground that has opened its arms to receive the blood of your murdered brother. You?ll farm this ground, but it will no longer give you its best. You?ll be a homeless wanderer on Earth.?

(13-14) Cain said to God, ?My punishment is too much. I can?t take it! You?ve thrown me off the land and I can never again face you. I?m a homeless wanderer on Earth and whoever finds me will kill me.?

(15) God told him, ?No. Anyone who kills Cain will pay for it seven times over.? God put a mark on Cain to protect him so that no one who met him would kill him.

(16) Cain left the presence of God and lived in No-Man?s-Land, east of Eden.","greek creation myth begin chaos void appear erebus unknowable place death dwell night else empty silent endless darkness

You said such nice things about me, I felt guilty and cheap
You took two steps to the kitchen and just stared at the sink

You having sex in the morning, your love was foreign to me
It made me think maybe human's not such a bad thing to be

For those who been to jail, that's the cat with the Kool-Aid on his lips and pumps
I don't fuck with niggas that think they broads
Only know how to be one way, that's the dog
I know how to get down, know how to bite
Bark very little, but I know how to fight
I know how to chase a cat up in the tree

Once it's on, I come through, guns is drawn
Blam blam, lungs are gone, sons will mourn
From dusk till dawn, nighttime belongs to the dog
On the street past midnight, look for 'em in the morgue
Don't play with these cats
'Cause I ain't got nothin' to say to these cats
For the mothers that really do love 'em, please pray for these cats

Five CD's with mad rhymes
Don't hit me with that positive shit, I know you lyin'
You really wanna stop niggas from dyin'? Stop niggas from tryin'
'Cause I ain't really got that time to waste
And I thought I told you to get these fuckin' bums out my face
Lookin' at you in your grill, I might be nice to cut
Once I split your ass in two, you'll be twice as butt
Yeah, you right, I know your style: pussy, 'cause I'm fuckin' it
Since we all right here, you hold my dick while he suckin' it
Motherfucker, don't you know you'll never come near me?
Shove your head up your ass, have you seein' shit clearly
Never heard that D be runnin', because D be gunnin'

I sleep in late, another day
Oh, what a wonder, oh, what a waste
It's a Monday, it's so mundane
What exciting things will happen today?
The yard is full of hard rubbish, it's a mess and
I guess the neighbours must think we run a meth lab
We should amend that, I pull the sheets back
It's forty degrees and I feel like I'm dying
Life's getting hard in here so I do some gardening
Anything to take my mind away from where it's supposed to be
The nice lady next door talks of green beds
And all the nice things that she wants to plant in them
I wanna grow tomatoes on the front steps
Sunflowers, bean sprouts, sweet corn and radishes
I feel proactive, I pull out weeds
All of a sudden

My hands are shaky, my knees are weak
I can't seem to stand on my own two feet
I'm breathing but I'm wheezing, feel like I'm emphysem-ing
My throat feels like a funnel filled with Weet-Bix and kerosene and
Oh no, next thing I know they call up triple-0
I'd rather die than owe the hospital 'til I get old
I get adrenaline straight to the heart
I feel like Uma Thurman post-overdosing kick start
Reminds me of the time when I was really sick and I
Had too much pseudoephedrine and I couldn't sleep at night
Halfway down High Street, Andy looks ambivalent
He's probably wondering what I'm doing getting in an ambulance
The paramedic thinks I'm clever 'cause I play guitar
I think she's clever 'cause she stops people dying
Anaphylactic and super hypocondriactic
Should've stayed in bed today, I much prefer the mundane
I take a hit from an asthma puffer
I do it wrong, I was never good at smoking bongs

[Chorus]
I'm not that good at breathing in
I'm not that good at breathing in
I'm not that good at breathing in"," sleep late another day oh wonder oh waste monday mundane excite thing will happen today yard full hard rubbish mess guess neighbour must think run meth lab amend pull sheet back forty degree feel like dying lifes get hard garden anything take mind away suppose nice lady next door talk green bed nice thing want plant wanna grow tomato front step sunflower bean sprout sweet corn radish feel proactive pull weed sudden trouble breathe trouble breathe trouble breathe trouble breathe hand shaky knee weak can seem stand two foot breathe wheeze feel like emphysem ing throat feel like funnel fill weet bix kerosene oh next thing know call triple rather die owe hospital get old get adrenaline straight heart feel like uma thurman post overdose kick start remind time really sick much pseudoephedrine can sleep night halfway high street andy look ambivalent probably wonder get ambulance paramedic think clever play guitar think clever stop people dying anaphylactic super hypocondriactic stay bed today much prefer mundane take hit asthma puffer wrong never good smoke bong good breathe good breathe good breathe ","pop","all",180,-0.268328157299975,"c(""wonder"", ""excite"", ""like"", ""nice"", ""nice"", ""sweet"", ""proactive"", ""like"", ""like"", ""like"", ""wonder"", ""clever"", ""clever"", ""super"", ""prefer"", ""good"", ""good"", ""good"", ""good"")","c(""waste"", ""mundane"", ""hard"", ""rubbish"", ""mess"", ""dying"", ""hard"", ""weed"", ""trouble"", ""trouble"", ""trouble"", ""trouble"", ""shaky"", ""weak"", ""die"", ""sick"", ""ambivalent"", ""dying"", ""mundane"", ""wrong"", ""smoke"")"," sleep late another day oh wonder oh waste monday mundane excite thing will happen today yard full hard rubbish mess guess neighbour must think run meth lab amend pull sheet back forty degree feel like dying lifes get hard garden anything take mind away suppose nice lady next door talk green bed nice thing want plant wanna grow tomato front step sunflower bean sprout sweet corn radish feel proactive pull weed sudden trouble breathe trouble breathe trouble breathe trouble breathe hand shaky knee weak can seem stand two foot breathe wheeze feel like emphysem ing throat feel like funnel fill weet bix kerosene oh next thing know call triple rather die owe hospital get old get adrenaline straight heart feel like uma thurman post overdose kick start remind time really sick much pseudoephedrine can sleep night halfway high street andy look ambivalent probably wonder get ambulance paramedic think clever play guitar think clever stop people dying anaphylactic super hypocondriactic stay bed today much prefer mundane take hit asthma puffer wrong never good smoke bong good breathe good breathe good breathe "

Yo, whassup? This is Tajai
Of the mighty Souls of Mischief crew
I'm chillin' with my man Phesto, my man A-Plus
And my man Op', you know he's dope (yo)
But right now, y'know, we just maxin' in the studio
We hailin' from East Oakland, California
And, um, sometimes it gets a little hectic out there
But right now, yo, we gonna up you on how we just chill

[Verse 1: Opio]
Dial the seven digits, call up Bridgette
Her man's a midget; plus she got friends, yo, I can dig it
Here's a 40, swig it, you know it's frigid
I got 'em chillin' in the cooler, break out the ruler
Damn! That's the fattest dope I ever seen
The weather's heat in Cali
Gettin' weeded makes it feel like Maui
Now we feel the good vibrations
So many females, so much inspiration

[Verse 2: A-Plus]
I get inspired by the blunts too
I'll front you, if you hang with a bunk crew
I roam the strip for bones to pick
When I find one, I'm done
Take her home and quickly do this
I need not explain this (Nah)
A-Plus is famous, so get the anus!

[Verse 3: Tajai]
Hey, Miss! Who's there? I'm through there
No time to do hair; the flick's at eight, so get straight
You look great ? let's grub now
A rub down sounds flavor, later there's the theatre
We in the cut, the cinema was mediocre
Take her to the crib so I can stroke her

[Verse 4: Phesto]
Kids get broke for their skins when I'm in
Close range, I throws game at your dip
Like handball, ?cause the man's all that
All phat, I be the chill from 93 'til

[Hook: Souls of Mischief]
Yeah, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
Uh-huh, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill? from 93 'til

[Verse 5: A-Plus]
Huh, my black Timbs do me well (yeah)
When I see a fool and he says he heard me tell (what?)
Another person's business, I cause dizziness
Until you stop acting like a silly bitch

[Verse 6: Phesto]
Yo, crews are jealous 'cause we get props
The cops, wanna stop our fun, but the top
Is where we're dwellin', swell and fat, no sleep
I work fit, and jerks get their hoes sweeped
Under their noses, this bro's quick
They hit blunts and flip once
I'm chillin', ?cause my crew's close, kid

[Verse 7: Tajai]
I'm posted, most kids accept this as cool
I exit, ?cause I'm an exception to the rule
I'm steppin' to the cool spots where crews flock
To snare a dip, or see where the shit that's flam B
Blam leakin' out his pocket
So I got tons of indo and go to the Owen's basement
My ace been fattenin' up tracks
Time to get prolific with the whiz kid

[Verse 8: Opio]
Greenbacks in stacks, don't even ask
Who got the fat sacks? We can max pumpin' fat tracks
Exchangin' facts about impacts, ?cause in facts
My freestyle talent overpowers, brothers can't hack it
They lack wit, we got the mack shit
'93 'Til Infinity ? kill all that wack shit!

[Hook: Souls of Mischief]
Yeah, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
Uh-huh, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill? from 93 'til

[Verse 9: Phesto]
I be coolin', school's in session, but I'm fresh in
Rappin', so I take time off to never rhyme soft
I'm off on my own shit
With my own clique, roll many backroads
With a fat stog' and blunt, foldin' runts
Holdin' stunts captive with my persona
Plus a bomber, zestin'
Niggas is testin' my patience, but I stay fresh, and?

[Verse 10: Tajai]
Restin' at the mall, attendance on 'noid
But I am shoppin' for my wish to exploit
Some ill fits, some new kicks
I often do this, ?cause it's the pits not being dipped

[Verse 11: Opio]
Flip the flyer attire females desire
Baby, you can step to this if you admire
The extraordinary, dapper rapper
Keep tabs on your main squeeze before I tap her

[Verse 12: A-Plus]
I'll mack her, attack her with the smoothness
I do this, peepin' what my crew gets (Huh)
Loot, props, respect, and blunts to pass
Crews talk shit, but in my face they kiss my ass (Smack!)
They bite flows, but we make up new ones
If you're really dope, why ain't you signed yet?
But I get my loot from Jive/Zomba
I'ma bomb ya; you will see, from now 'til infinity

[Hook: Souls of Mischief]
Yeah, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
Uh-huh, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill? from 93 'til

[Outro: Souls of Mischief]
Hah-hah, just coolin' out, y'know what I'm sayin'?
But, but who's chillin' around the land, y'know?
Yo, who's chillin'? I think I know who's chillin'
Yeah, tell me who's chillin' then, Plus
Casual ? you know he's chillin'
Yo, Pep Love ? he gotta be chillin'
Jay-Biz ? you know he's chillin'
Ayo, man, my man Snupe is chillin', man
Yo, Mike G ? you know he's here chillin'

Uh, yeah. Uh-huh
We got Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth
And we're here to tell you to...
And that's a fact, baby
Now you're gonna kick some lyrics
Like this, c'mon...

[Verse 1: C.L. Smooth]
Walk the fine chalk line, and put the needle to the grind
Representin' one kind, seeing eye for the blind
Witness what I carry on bears a further purpose
From how we do slam a few, then you want to purchase
A dialogue of funk, you love to pop it in your trunk
I win, more disciplined than a Shaolin monk
Pete Rock and C.L., well set to spark it
The powerful target to destroy the black market
But when you say black, listen, I don't know, you lose me
I guess another beggar can afford to be choosey
I come to the maximum, artist on a major label
Any duplication of this one is fatal
On one two five, I gotta hit ya live
Beat your ass with my tape, any race or shape
Cuz if they got mine, they got yours too
But together here's what we gotta do

[Chorus: Pete Rock]
Tell 'em... straighten it out
Ah, yeah... straighten it out
You know this is the word (say what?)... straighten it out
That's right y'all... straighten it out (say what?)
You got to... straighten it out
Everybody must... straighten it out (say what?)
Straighten it out... yeah
Straighten it out... it's like that (say what?)

[Verse 2: C.L. Smooth]
The funk legacy I pass on, clearancy for high rates
Every time we sample all the past time greats
Stick it in the SP-1200 beat, I make a loop
Lovely, way to troop in a Lexus coupe
Just a little bit, set to make a whole lot happen
The musical inside my rappin'
Written by the C.L., produced by the P.R
And add in any credit that you heard thus far
I start from scratch, cuz the bassline's critical
Better than the original who first made it
Now you want to sue me, but fans never boo me
Believe I know the times, we been broke, too, G
Here's another sample clear, see ya, get the hell outta here
Like a bootleg, you're over for the year
You'll only get the credit where the credit is due
So, listen, what I shout out is true

[Chorus: Pete Rock]
Yeah, true... straighten it out
You gots to tell 'em to... straighten it out
(Say what?)... straighten it out
You got to tell 'em to... straighten it out
(Say what?)... straighten it out
That's right... straighten it out
C'mon (say what?)... straighten it out
That's right... straighten it out
Straighten it out (say what?)

[Verse 3: C.L. Smooth]
Like the strands of lamb's wool, I'm thinkin' that's said
Here to go to the head and count the locks on a dred
I and I'd 'mit to verify, goin' to multiply
A theory many thought a conspiracy
Here to let you know that it applies to all of us
You're no exceptions to the rule and that's a plus
Cause who Jah bless, let no one curse
Straighten out what I be about, reckon above the clout
And let the management work for me
Because I don't need the unnecessary hostility
A proper marketing plan so we can gobble up the dough
Straighten it out, so everybody know
The kids are official with the purpose of a smooth surface
Kickin' the service one time to make 'em nervous
We're finally here and very long overdue
Pete Rock, this one's for the crew

[Chorus: Pete Rock]
You gotta... straighten it out
Everybody must... straighten it out (say what?)
You gotta... straighten it out
Everybody must... straighten it out (say what?)
Straighten it out... you got to
Straighten it out... c'mon (say what?)
Straighten it out
All black people must... straighten it out
Say what?

[Outro: Pete Rock]
Straighten it out
Everybody must... straighten it out
The YG's, they must... straighten it out
The Hilltop, they must...straighten it out
The whole money-earnin' must... straighten it out
Everybody must... straighten it out

Through all the pain and all the scars
The world is mine, what's mine is yours
Your love is true, your heart is pure
Always ready but never sure
When I get lonely, baby, you're the cure
My love for you, it never fades
My love for you, it never dies
I never wanna drift away

Ha-Ha! Well now, we call this the act of mating
But there are several other very important differences
Between human beings and animals that you should know about

I'd appreciate your input

[Verse 1]
Sweat baby, sweat baby, sex is a Texas drought
Me and you do the kind of stuff that only Prince would sing about
So put your hands down my pants and I'll bet you'll feel nuts
Yes, I'm Siskel, yes, I'm Ebert and you're getting two thumbs up
You've had enough of two-hand touch, you want it rough, you're out of bounds
I want you smothered, want you covered, like my Waffle House hash browns
Come quicker than FedEx, never reach an apex, just like Coca-Cola stock, you are inclined
To make me rise an hour early, just like Daylight Savings Time

[Chorus]
Do it now
You and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals
So, let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel
Do it again now
You and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals
So, let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel
Getting horny now

[Verse 2]
Love, the kind you clean up with a mop and bucket
Like the lost catacombs of Egypt, only God knows where we stuck it
Hieroglyphics, let me be Pacific: I wanna be down in your South Seas
But I got this notion that the motion of your ocean means ""Small Craft Advisory""
So, if I capsize on your thighs high tide, B-5, you sunk my battleship
Please turn me on, I'm Mister Coffee with an automatic drip
So show me yours, I'll show you mine, ""Tool Time,"" you'll Lovett just like Lyle
And then we'll do it doggy style so we can both watch ""X-Files""

[Chorus]
Do it now
You and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals

Was in shootouts with the law, but he live in a palace
Bo-bought me Alexander McQueen, he was keeping me stylish
Now that's real, real, real
Gun in my purse, bitch, I came dressed to kill
Who wanna go first? I had them pushing daffodils
I'm high as hell, I only took a half a pill
I'm on some dumb shit, by the way, what he say?
He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills and he tellin' me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
Say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab

And when we talked, hours just stood by

Yet I still need some time

Before you break my heart

Before we even start something
I'm sorry I didn't call

Like a lonely glove nobody cares about
But you saw, something worth having
You picked me up, tugged on my heart strings
But I'm still cold inside

Somewhere down the line

You said let's take it slow

It only hurts my eyes right now

I was a little too tall
Could've used a few pounds
Tight pants points hardly renown
She was a black haired beauty with big dark eyes
And points all her own sitting way up high

{hook}

Way up firm and high

Out past the cornfields where the woods got heavy
Out in the back seat of my '60 Chevy
Workin' on mysteries without any clues
Workin' on our night moves
Trying' to make some front page drive-in news
Workin' on our night moves in the summertime
In the sweet summertime

We weren't in love oh no far from it
We weren't searching for some pie in the sky summit
We were just young and restless and bored
Living by the sword
And we'd steal away every chance we could
To the backroom, the alley, the trusty woods
I used her she used me
But neither one cared
We were getting our share

Workin' on our night moves
Trying to lose the awkward teenage blues
Workin' on out night moves
In the summertime
In the sweet summer time, summer time

{Bridge}

And oh the wonder
Felt the lightning
And we waited on the thunder
Waited on the thunder

I woke last night to the sound of thunder
How far off I sat and wondered
Started humming a song from 1962
Ain't it funny how the night moves
When you just don't seem to have as much to lose
Strange how the night moves
With autumn closing in

[Verse 2]
I thought that love was in the drugs
But the more I took, the more it took away
And I could never get enough
I thought that love was on the stage
You give yourself to strangers
You don't have to be afraid
And then it tries to find a home with people, oh, and I'm alone
Picking it apart and staring at your phone

So I topped off the bottle with more than a cap

To entertain the white folks and I'd pay him in booze

If it gets too slow

Hot tongue, cold shoulder
Who am I to turn my back on you?
Why bring this back to life?
Why raise the dead?
Why hold this gun up to my head? Mhm

But not the words
It's like a love song in reverse
I just don't love you
But don't know how to say

It gets stuck in my teeth
It gets stuck in my
It gets stuck in my teeth
Can't find the words to say goodbye

And while she looked so sad in photographs

How many days in a year?
She woke up with hope, but she only found tears
And I can be so insincere
Making her promises, never for real
As long as she stands there waiting
Wearing the holes in the soles of her shoes
How many days disappear?
When you look in the mirror, so how do you choose?

Your clothes never wear as well the next day
And your hair never falls in quite the same way
You never seem to run out of things to say

Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looked so sad in photographs
I absolutely love her when she smiles

Just to put up with this shit day after day?
How did we wind up this way?
Watching our mouths for the words that we say
As long as we stand here waiting
Wearing the clothes of the souls that we choose
How do we get there today?
When we're walking too far for the price of our shoes

Your clothes never wear as well the next day
And your hair never falls in quite the same way
But you never seem to run out of things to say

Lived a man who sailed to sea

And we played beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine

Something in the air is calling me
Turn the light on
Something about the night that makes you see
What you don?t want
I think about it every time I sleep
There is someone creeping at me
Swear they're haunting me
Telling me, ?Run?

Ooh, I feel my body move without me again
Ooh, like a sleepwalker getting closer to him
Getting closer to him

[Verse 2]
I think I might be going crazy now
Someone stop me
Forgot to lock the doors to keep me in
Didn?t hide the key
I feel the cold air, I feel the dirt under my toes
Something tells me that I?m far away
And I?m not alone

Ooh, I feel my body move without me again
Ooh, like a sleepwalker getting closer to him
Getting closer to him

Now we?re alone
Whispers disturb a quiet home
No one will know
No one, darling
Come close

All a nigga know is how to fuck a good thing up
Run from the pain, sip lean, smoke tree up
When I'm in your town press pound hit me up
When I'm in your town press pound hit me up
Only if you down and you slurp good D up
If the work good I'll be back for the re-up
Hate when I creep and the phone wake me up
Fake like I'm sleep knowing damn well I be up
Monkey on my back and I walk a hundred miles
Guilt make a nigga feel fake when he smile
Love get confused in the mind of a child
'Cause love wouldn't lie like I lie and it's wild
Wanna have my cake and another cake too
Even if the baker don't bake like you
Even when the flavor don't taste like you
So I'm back mobbing with the late night crew
All in your mind with fears that would come true
The back of my mind, the back of my mind was you
Wishing that I could blind myself from view
And only have eyes, and only have eyes for you

As I walk this land of broken dreams
I have visions of many things
But happiness is just an illusion
Filled with sadness and confusion

What becomes of the brokenhearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
Maybe

The roots of love grow all around
But for me they come a tumblin' down
Every day heartaches grow a little stronger
I can't stand this pain much longer

I walk in shadows searching for light
Cold and alone no comfort in sight
Hoping and praying for someone to care
Always moving and going nowhere

What becomes of the brokenhearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
Help me

I'm searching though I don't succeed
But someone look, there's a growing need
All is lost, there's no place for beginning
All that's left is an unhappy ending

Now what becomes of the broken-hearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
I'll be searching everywhere
Just to find someone to care

I'll be looking everyday
I know I'm gonna find a way
Nothing's gonna stop me now
I'll find a way somehow
I'll be searching everywhere"," intro walk land break dream vision many thing happiness just illusion fill sadness confusion become brokenhearted love now depart know get find kind peace mind maybe root love grow around come tumblin every day heartache grow little strong can stand pain much long walk shadow search light cold alone comfort sight hope pray someone care always move go nowhere become brokenhearted love now depart know get find kind peace mind help search though succeed someone look grow need lose place begin leave unhappy end now become break hearted love now depart know get find kind peace mind will search everywhere just find someone care will look everyday know gonna find way nothings gonna stop now will find way somehow will search everywhere","pop","all",122,0.181071492085037,"c(""happiness"", ""love"", ""peace"", ""love"", ""strong"", ""comfort"", ""love"", ""peace"", ""succeed"", ""love"", ""peace"")","c(""break"", ""illusion"", ""sadness"", ""confusion"", ""pain"", ""cold"", ""lose"", ""unhappy"", ""break"")"," intro walk land break dream vision many thing happiness just illusion fill sadness confusion become brokenhearted love now depart know get find kind peace mind maybe root love grow around come tumblin every day heartache grow little strong can stand pain much long walk shadow search light cold alone comfort sight hope pray someone care always move go nowhere become brokenhearted love now depart know get find kind peace mind help search though succeed someone look grow need lose place begin leave unhappy end now become break hearted love now depart know get find kind peace mind will search everywhere just find someone care will look everyday know gonna find way nothings gonna stop now will find way somehow will search everywhere"

Yea this right here is goin' out to all them girls out there
That did me or Southstar you know tell y'all a little story

[Chorus]
Love hate
Mistakes
Tell me what you think is going on
We date all day
All day
Tell me what you think is going on
Two late
Heart break
Tell me what you think is going on

Whats going on
Whats going on

And yo me and ms. thang
We were the perfect team
We had all the things all them other couples dreamed
Love, trust, good sex, and security
If you ever felt weak, smilez was your energy
Trips across seas
Showed you the finer things
No more burger king, it was fine dine cuisine
And if we never had it
I don't think it mattered
We were a class A like Nas and Illmatic
I was so deceived, I thought we had a thing
You used to blow my two way up with 1-4-3s
The l-o-v had me blind I wouldn't have seen
I trusted my friends, all they were yelling at me
How could you do me so wrong
I don't want get gone
I invested three years ma plus this song
I'm so confused
Where to go how do I choose
I guess to find real love
I got to pay my dues

[Chorus]
It seemed so good
Yo we used to chill in the hood
You made me feel that tingle in
My heart like nobody could
And all along we stood
When times is hard
Even before all this rap shit made me a star
When I was working two jobs just to survive
When I felt like killing my self
You kept me alive
What a pair
Me and you we was a match
Different tastes but you know opposites attract
By my side, held my head and kept me strong
Still trying to figure out where the hell we went wrong
I did what I can young cat being a man
Stayed when ever the storm when most would have ran
Too much pride, and you know men don't cry
Had to let you go even though it hurt inside
All by myself, now I had to turn to these rhymes
It's the only way I know to release my mind

[Chorus]
Its been a while
Yea you know time goes fast
Let me tell you though, some things still don't pass
Sit back in the pad think, about the times we had
Try not to let it make me sad or make me mad
I'm trying to move on with my life
The wound is healed
Yea I'm just speaking it real, I'm ready to feel
Ready to provide for my seed
A man now, bet you can't believe its me

You ruined a good thing
And all of our dreams
Trying to lock me down a life time in the bing
Monitoring my calls
Piping at mah dogs
Shit, I never really understood the cause
My friends were your friends
Your friends were my friends
Your dough is my dough
My dough is my dough
Mono e mono
We'll foot this weather
And everybody that been through it, then sing it together
Come on

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Alls my life I has to fight, nigga
Alls my life I...
Hard times like, ""Yah!""
Bad trips like, ""Yah!""
Nazareth, I'm fucked up
Homie, you fucked up
But if God got us, then we gon' be alright

[Hook: Pharrell Williams]
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, and when I wake up
I recognize you're looking at me for the pay cut
But homicide be looking at you from the face down
What MAC-11 even boom with the bass down?
Schemin', and let me tell you 'bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight
Now tell my momma I love her, but this what I like, Lord knows
Twenty of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me
Reaping everything I sow, so my karma comin' heavy
No preliminary hearings on my record
I'm a motherfucking gangster in silence for the record
Tell the world I know it's too late
Boys and girls, I think I gone cray
Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I say

[Pre-Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before
Nigga, when our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, ""Where do we go?""
Nigga, and we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho'
Nigga, I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright

[Hook: Pharrell Williams]
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
What you want you: a house or a car?
Forty acres and a mule? A piano, a guitar?
Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I can see the evil, I can tell it, I know it's illegal
I don't think about it, I deposit every other zero
Thinking of my partner, put the candy, paint it on the Regal
Digging in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you
Every day my logic get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico... Ah!
I don't talk about it, be about it, every day I sequel
If I got it then you know you got it, Heaven, I can reach you
Pet dog, pet dog, pet dog, my dog, that's all
Pick back and chat, I trap the back for y'all
I rap, I black on track so rest assured
My rights, my wrongs; I write 'til I'm right with God

[Pre-Hook: Kendrick Lamar]

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
I keep my head up high
I cross my heart and hope to die
Lovin' me is complicated
Too afraid, a lot of changes
I'm alright, and you're a favorite
Dark nights in my prayers

[Poem]
I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me

It's getting to the point
Where I am no fun anymore
I am sorry
Sometimes it hurts so badly I must cry out loud
'I am lonely.'
I am yours, you are mine
You are what you are
You make it hard

Remember what we've said
And done and felt about each other
Oh babe, have mercy
Don't let the past
Remind us of what we are not now
I am not dreaming
I am yours, you are mine
You are what you are
You make it hard

Tearing yourself away from me now
You are free
And I am crying

I do, that's forever
Yes and for always
I am yours, you are mine
You are what you are
You make it hard

Something inside is telling me
That I've got your secret
Are you still listening?
Fear is the lock and laughter the key
To your heart
And I love you
I am yours, you are mine
You are what you are
And you make it hard
And you make it hard
And you make it hard
And you make it hard

Friday evening, Sunday in the afternoon
What have you got to lose?
Tuesday morning, please be gone, I'm tired of you
What have you got to lose?
Can I tell it like it is?
Listen to me baby-
It's my heart that's suffering
It's a-dying-
And that's what I have to lose

I've got an answer
I'm going to fly away
What have I got to lose?
Will you come see me Thursdays and Saturdays?
What have you got to lose?

Part 3

Chestnut brown canary
Ruby throated sparrow
Sing a song, don't be long
Thrill me to the marrow
Voices of the angels
Ring around the moonlight
Asking me, said she's so free
How can you catch the sparrow?

Change my life, make it right
Be my lady

Gave the keys to valet tell 'em to park it
Then I jumps out the Azure, a Lil' Kim aura
Girls making faces like Ace Ventura
And my B-A-D G-I-R-L-S is in the stretch LX
Ain't shit you can tell us
Even got some of these niggas jealous
But tonight ain't about the fellas
Bvlgari perfume from a mile ya smell us
Model agencies say it's easy to sell us
We got sex appeal, I'ma keep it real
If I didn't have a deal I'd still be worth a mill', uh
Depending on how I feel I might go on a heist
So at my wedding I can throw ice instead of throwing rice
We fly like kites never gettin' into fights
I got a whole bunch of dykes on ninja bikes

So why y'all keep hating on me and my crew?
Yo, I'm saying Q.B, look at them and look at you
True, if I was you I'd hate me too
Louis Vuitton shoes and a whole lot of booze
Every other week a different dude and other crews
I make offers nobody can refuse
You might even see me on the channel nine news
I get paid just for laying in the shade
To take pictures with a glass of lemonade
My rocks shine like it was dipped in Cascade
(Uh-uh, Kim been fly since she was in the fifth grade)
Wake up in the morning to breakfast from a maid
Wanted me so bad you ain't copped or bootleg
Y'all niggas played like a high top fade
Some of the shit I hear I don't know how it got played
Y'all rock Versace and y'all went out and bought it
I rock Versace and y'all know I ain't paid for it

When the Queen come in town everything shut down

To rock it to the bang-bang boogie
To up jump the boogie
To the boogie to the boogedy beat
Now what you hear is not a fake
It's the real Lil' Kim, Queen Bee (That's right)
Now I know y'all heard other females rap
But they ain't got nothin' on me
'Cause, y'all take to my rap cause my rap's the best
A hundred and fifty thou, sixteen bars nothin less (Nothin less)
So to y'all haters, I paid y'all no mind

Then my only worry was for Christmas what would be my toy
Even though we sometimes would not get a thing
We were happy with the joy the day would bring

Sneaking out the back door to hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine
Greeted at the back door with, ""Boy, thought I told you not to go outside!""
Tryin' your best to bring the water to your eyes
Thinkin' it might stop her from woopin' your behind

I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days e-ver have to go?
I wish those days could, come back once more
Why did those days e-ver have to go?
'Cause I love them so

Brother says he's tellin' 'bout you playin' doctor with that girl
Just don't tell, an' I'll give you anythin' you want in this whole wide world
Mama gives you money for Sunday school
You trade yours for candy, after church is through

Smokin' cigarettes, writing something nasty on the wall (You nasty boy!)
Teacher sends you to the principal's office down the hall
You grow up and learn that kinda thing ain't right
But while you were doin' it it sure felt outta sight

I wanna be a billionaire so fucking bad
Buy all of the things I never had
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
Oh, every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shiny lights, yeah
A different city every night, oh, I, I swear
The world better prepare for when I'm a billionaire

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
Yeah, I would have a show like Oprah, I would be the host of
Everyday Christmas, give Travie a wish list
I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt
And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had shit
Give away a few Mercedes, like, here lady have this
And last but not least, grant somebody their last wish
It's been a couple months that I've been single so
You can call me Travie Claus minus the ho ho
Aha, get it?
I'd probably visit where Katrina hit
And damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did
Yeah, can't forget about me, stupid
Everywhere I go I'mma have my own theme music

[Chorus: Bruno Mars & Travie McCoy]
Oh, every time I close my eyes (what you see, what you see brah?)
I see my name in shiny lights (uh-ha, uh-ha, yeah, what else?)
Yeah, a different city every night, oh, I, I swear
The world better prepare (for what?) for when I'm a billionaire
Oh-oh, oh-oh, when I'm a billionaire
Oh-oh, oh-oh (let's go)

[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]
I be playing basketball with the president
Dunking on his delegates
Then I compliment on his political etiquette
Toss a couple milli' in the air just for the heck of it
But keep the fives, twennies, tens, and bens completely separate
And yeah, I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatever's left and just split it up
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks
And not a single tummy around me
Would know what hungry was
Eating good, sleeping soundly
I know we all have a similar dream
Go in your pocket pull out your wallet
And put it in the air and sing

Heut sind wir alle noch zusamm'n im Park
So viel Zeit, wissen nicht mal, wohin
Maximal Kleingeld auf Tasche
So weit weg von Gold und Platin (Platin), ey
Auf MTV Cribs seh'n wir die Stars
Doch alles, was sie hab'n, macht fr uns keinen Sinn
Doch geben ein'n Dreck auf die Rolex
Hauptsache, zusamm'n mit dem Team

[Part 1: Kontra K]
Wir hatten zu wenig, aber davon reichlich
Die Air Max tot, aber trugen uns weit weg
Heute im Mercedes AMG, alles Hightech
Was bringt mir die Scheie, wenn ich darin allein sitz'?
Worte hatten recht, weil sie ehrlich gemeint sind
Versprechen einen Sinn, denn sie wurden gehalten
Doch hier ist die Liebe keinen Cent mehr wert
Denn sie hlt nur so lange, wie die Spotlights scheinen
Warum willst du weg von dem Glck, was du hast?
Es wre perfekt, genau so, wie es war
Ich halt' den Moment fest, solang ich noch kann
Doch er verschwindet im Schatten, geht das Rampenlicht an
Es wird nie sein wie frher, wir nenn'n uns noch Brder
Und seh'n uns maximal einmal im Jahr
Doch jedes Leid, jeder Gig, jede goldene Platte
Zerschneidet nur weiter das Band

[Hook: RAF Camora]
Ich hoffe, du wirst niemals fame
Denn erst dann merkst du, was wirklich fehlt
Du bist weg, auf nie Wiedersehen
Dein Leben wird uns nur von Bildern erzhlt
Ich hoffe, du wirst niemals fame
Denn erst dann merkst du, was wirklich fehlt
Du bist weg, auf nie Wiedersehen
Dein Leben wird uns nur von Bildern erzhlt

[Part 2: Kontra K]
Denn Gold am Arm hlt nachts nicht warm
Paranoia dich wach, die Waffen scharf
Statt Loyalitt, die dein'n Rcken schtzt
Hngt hinter dir nur noch ein Rattenschwanz von Neidern
Alles klebt an dein'n Lippen wie die Filter von Kippen
Weil niemand mehr nein sagt
Gottverdammt, bist du einsam
Kein Klick, kein Reim, keine Bitch, kein Like
Kein Hit, kein Hype bleibt mehr, wenn du liegst
Kein Fick, kein Nike, kein Stift, kein Mic
Kein Blitzlicht scheint mehr sechs Fu tief
Nur noch Erde und Knochen
Und keine Wand voll mit Platten aus Gold
Ich gnn' dir von Herzen (glaub mir, von Herzen)
Doch nichts ist umsonst und erst recht nicht Erfolg

Du kannst gren, wen du willst
Keiner denkt mehr an dich im Bezirk
Denn du bist nicht mehr hier
Als httest du nie existiert, ahh
Schei auf deine YouTube-Klicks
Wir treffen uns nicht einmal zum Kaffee
Nicht mal ?Hallo, wie geht's??
Bruder, was ist passiert?
Denk' an die Tage
Und wei noch, wie ich zu dir sagte

Comin up slammin Cadillac doors

[Verse Three: Big Boi]
Back in the day when I was younger, hunger
Lookin to fill me belly with that Rally's, bullshit, pull shit
Off like it was supposed to be pulled
Full as a tick I was, stoned like white boys
Smokin them white golds before them blunts got krunk, chunky asses
Passes gettin thrown like Hail Mary's and they lookin like Halle Berry
So so fine, intertwined, but we ain't sippin wine
We's just chillin, I'm the rabid villain, and I'm so high
Smokin freely, me Lil B, Greet, Mon and Shug
And my little brother James, thangs changed in the hood
Where I live at, them rats know, mama I want to sing but
Mama I want to trick, and mama I'm suckin dick, now
We movin on up in da world like elevators
Me and the crew we pimps like eighty-two
Me and you like Tony Toni Tone
Like this Eastpointe and we gone

[Chorus]

[Verse Four: Andre]
Got stopped at the mall the other day
Heard a call from the other way
That I just came from, some nigga was sayin somethin
Talkin bout ""Hey man, you remember me from school?"" smoke some
Naw not really but he kept smilin like a clown
Facial expression lookin silly
And he kept askin me, what kind of car you drive, I know you paid
I know y'all got beaucoup of hoes from all them songs that y'all done made
And I replied that I had been goin through tha same thing that he had
True I got more fans than the average man but not enough loot to last me
To the end of the week, I live by the beat like you live check to check
If you don't move yo' feet then I don't eat, so we like neck to neck
Yes we done come a long way like them slim ass cigarettes
From Virginia, this ain't gon stop so we just gonna continue

Cash Mohammed, McGreggor Conor, Folarin

[Verse 1]
Yeah, mind racin', negotiatin' my situation
I burned bridges I can't repair so been fly lately
I've been peddlin' rhymes so much my calves hurt
Fly pelican fly, Tony Montana work
Yeah I'm comfortable, tell my other label I love 'em
Create a record, collect a check, take my name from it
The face on that plain Jane can replace budgets
Princess cutter shoe pop singers that can't cut it
The ghostwritin',  both pockets is pulsatin'
For the reign of power I'll put you with Rania fifth season
These niggas streamin' they shit, they weak but they entertainin' Don't ever confuse being great with being famous
I'm that nigga fa'sho, I'm that nigga fa'sho
Some of the niggas was humble with me, look how they switch up
Look how they talk to you different like you ain't better than them
You niggas go up in Ellen, forget your Melanin quick
Niggas need a new legend, the people never forget
I mean a rebel that take the Devil on one-on-one
And pray alot with God, well now his confidence in a gun
I know alot of rappers who spot 'em after I take it from 'em
So whoever doubt me gone need a balcony and a jump

[Bridge]
You see this motherfuckin' face
You remember this motherfucker
But you'll never want to meet a motherfucker like me
You understand?

[Verse 2]
Mind racin', negotiatin' my situation
I'm bad business, the rap industry thinks I'm crazy
The gatekeepers, they hate me say I'm militant
Really? niggas don't feel you unless you doin' that nigga shit
No Folarin, never change never give up your soul Folarin
And do your thing 'cause you givin' 'em hope Folarin
You know they say they only love you when broke or dead
But I can't count on that and I'm in my ghoster car
Nigga done wrote some bars my shit is boastful always for the culture
Got on by my lonesome, you Sofia Coppola
Y'all might be dope but you on 'cause you know somebody
Oh, yeah, my opposition ain't no competition
What you call a booth I call a kitchen, I'm fryin' different
Eyes lower than Shyne numbers but my vision God-level
'Cause I focus every four bifocals, sixteens is unmatched
Pistols in y'all hand like Brita, they untapped
Bitter niggas be reckless, they disrespectful and envious
And so you niggas is Breakfast, where Desus and Mero at?
Margiela apparel, what Virgil say he ain't sent me
This shit was a retail so don't check where my check is at
Ain't playin' with little niggas 'cause I ain't with tit for tat
But throwin' subliminals make your woman a widow fast and then I dash
Jerry Lorenzo, I'm finna blow a bag now
2007 the rappers had no swag now
All of these niggas Supreme, nothing is different with me
When I played receiver, I perfected the fly route
Highly respected, tell these labels I'm iced out
I'm feelin' like Beckham, I tell them let the price out
I'm lyrically celibate, any status y'all want
Motherfuckers ain't fuckin' with a nigga from Naija
Baba Folarin, untapped potential but still tap your woman
Okay, Baba Folarin, my side just might tax you like Mike Rotunda
Oh yeah, I never fumble
A Betty Lennox in a Bentley with the Helly on me
Bammas think I'm with the locals, come on, tell me something
Dread head get scoped and soaked until it's Shelly color
Woo! That's the MC, DMV about to peak, it ain't just me
I dare seven niggas step to me, OC
Sleep, how they peeps be awake for the whole week?
Funeral crowd, keep runnin' your mouth, nigga
The reaper within your reach, you keep reachin' for clout
Cloud of mine, I'm high, I'm tired, I'm tried
I tried, goodbye my love, the fourth time's a charm, I'm signed...

I remember when I first met you
Sipping coffee in a corner booth
You were twirling your hair
And I just had to stare
For a minute or two

Then you shot me that smile
Hey beautiful girl, in your own little world
Let me in it

But you just doing your thing
Ain't nobody ever seen nothing like you

When you're wearing them worn out jeans
Purple untied shoestrings
You're a light in the dark
And you're stealing my heart like a gypsy

In front of everybody
So baby come and kiss me

[Chorus: Lil Skies]
And I got all the drugs in the world that you need
We get high to pass time but bitch I ain't no fiend
I got money on my mind, I be stacking my green
Shawty said she like my style, I be dripping with ease
Please don't send me naked pictures, I don't like to be teased
Say she got that super soaker, well girl just let me see
I ain't worried bout shit, these niggas ain't scaring me
I was destined for this life, this is my destiny
Friends wanna be friends when you doing the most
How you tell me you my bro then you went out and told
Niggas say they down to ride but be folding like clothes
Purple hearts all on my garment, I ain't trusting a soul

[Verse 1: Lil Skies]
I roll up the Mary Jane, no they can't feel my pain
I'm still trapping everyday, I think I'm stuck in my ways
If you looking for a handout get the fuck out my face
I don't care about no friends because they all were just fake
In my inbox like I owe you, I got this by myself
I was broken down bad when you said you would help
Now I'm up, they love to hate me, that's just bad for your health
And she say she a college girl but left her books on the shelf
She gon' fuck me like a porn star, a rock star
Trying to skirt off in that fast car, like NASCAR
Girl you know I got a cold heart
If I would give it to you, would you tear that shit apart
Red roses on my grave, bury me with art
And with some Backwoods and a lighter just so I could spark
Midnight rider, never put the car in park
I'm shining bright just like a light cause I came from the dark
I ain't never had nobody, put that on my mommy
I might have to catch a body if you try to stop me
She ride like a Kawasaki and she like it sloppy
Oh you got a hotty body, come ride on my Johnny
Imma go show you the wave, just give me some space
Why you all up in my face like you need a taste
Good designer on my waist, shooters keep the K
I tell them boys to play it safe, don't lay in your grave
I ain't never taking time off, I'm steady grinding
I'm never lying, was never crying
Take flights I'm flying, no you can't see me
Say you need me but you deceive me

[Chorus: Lil Skies]
And I got all the drugs in the world that you need
We get high to pass time but bitch I ain't no fiend

I ain?t never forgotten, not a soul worth remembering
Cause all these motherfuckers turn to foe when they envy
So I don't talk, I work hard
Cause you could be someone today and just be nobody tomorrow
She said I'll never be shit but a god damn rock star

Never see a cell, not even a courthouse

A matter of time before a total divide yah
You cross the line, man draw quick fi remind you

Sir Lucious gots gator belts and patty melts and Monte Carlos
And El Dorados; so I'm waking up out of my slumber feeling like Rollo
So follow, it's Showtime at the Apollo minus the Kiki Shepards
What about a ho in a leopard-print? Ah
Teddy Pendergrass, cooler than Freddie Jackson
Sipping a milkshake in a snowstorm
Left her throat warm in the dorm room at the A.U
We blew hay too, athletes might cake you
But you must have me mistaken with them statements that you make 'cause

YKK on your zipper, lick you like a lizard when I'm slizzard

And tellin' me everything that's on your nasty mind
They say you're malnutritioned, in need of vitamin D
And invitin' me to that tingle in your spine
I love who you are, I love who you ain't ? you're so Anne Frank
Let's hit the attic to hide out for 'bout two weeks
Rick James'n, no chains and whips
I do suck lips 'til hips jerk in double time

[Verse 1: Erick Arc Elliott]
Bleedin' through people to see these stars
I'm needed in cities large
Look down, tote out, break down these walls
A stupid man could evolve
Losers told me I wouldn't be on the Earth for this long
My resurgence was strong, what do I do this for?
Gotta relieve, gotta release, everything beautiful
My fabric needs, kiss my niece, money don't soothe the soul
Ain't nobody perfect anyway, mama poured a glass of Minute Maid
Rid me from the evils thataway, the ones I gotta say

No one gets out alive
So we livin' like we already died
No one will ever understand but the sky
Sometimes it's hard to focus with these voices inside the mind
I'm a demon to some, I'm a angel to others
Gotta die for what you love or love until it kills you
Don't be the type to talk about shit and not live it
I manifested every single one of my visions
So I only blame myself when I don't make it to the finish
Please don't let this perception become your reflection
Uh, but excuse my aggression 'cause my tribe called for questions
If I'm made in God's image, tell me why am I blemished?
Simple question, huh, quite perplexin'
Them snakes will say they love you but hate you, that's type deceptive

Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number

I had a carbon I was fifteen
We was trying to steal and rob everything
I can't even talk about what I seen
I'm never telling the laws a thing
Made it out alive, can't even lie that shit was awesome nigga
Shootouts I ain't had no bullets I had to call some niggas
Lost lil Juan in the middle of the summer, that shit was awful nigga
As soon as we found out some witness who tell us who did it, we gon' off them nigga
Had to cut off a couple niggas I thought was with me, tried to cross a nigga
These niggas think they can just come and kick shit in my city, it's gon' cost them nigga
Jumped in the game and went got me some millions, no cap
I made a wave for us
Them bitches were fucking with me when I didn't have no money, now they can't wait to fuck
Every one of my lil buddies mama know we thuggin', that's why they pray for us
I was in the back of the back like Rosa Parks
Me and my dogs on Tec, a four or more
Grind every day like it ain't no tomorrow
I was just broke, ain't going back
I'ma run mines up to the max
I want the cheese, ain't fuckin' with rats
I wanna fuck her I give her a rack
If she don't give me head ain't texting her back
I'm a dog I go deep in the cat
Remember one time I ain't had jack
I had a hunnid I bought me a pack
I took the pack and went got me a bag
It started rolling and coming in fast
I had the old heads hanging back
And I'm rich now and that's why they mad

[Verse 1]
I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or dream
Deep down inside I feel to scream
This terrible silence stops me
Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now

[Chorus 1]
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, wake me

Back in the womb it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live
Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me

All that I see
Absolute horror
I cannot live
I cannot die
Trapped in myself

Taken my speech
Taken my hearing
Taken my arms
Taken my legs
Taken my soul
Left me with life in hell

[Verso 1]
Yo he peleado con cocodrilos
Me he balanceado sobre un hilo cargando ms de quinientos kilos
Le he dado la vuelta al mundo en menos de un segundo
He cruzado 100 laberintos y nunca me confundo

Respiro dentro y fuera del agua como las focas
Soy a prueba de fuego, agarro balas con la boca
Mi creatividad vuela como los aviones
Puedo construir un cerebro sin leer las instrucciones

Hablo todos los idiomas de todos los abecedarios
Tengo ms vocabulario que cualquier diccionario
Tengo vista de guila, olfato de perro
Puedo caminar descalzo sobre clavos de hierro

Soy inmune a la muerte
No necesito bendiciones porque siempre tengo buena suerte
Ven conmigo a dar un paseo por el parque
Porque tengo ms cuentos que contarte que Garca Mrquez

Por ti, todo lo que hago lo hago por ti
Es que t me sacas lo mejor de m
Soy todo lo que soy
Porque t eres todo lo que quiero
Por ti, todo lo que hago lo hago por ti
Es que t me sacas lo mejor de m
Soy todo lo que soy
Porque t eres todo lo que quiero

[Verso 2]
Puedo brincar la cuerda con solo una pierna
Veo en la oscuridad sin usar una linterna
Cocino lo que quieras, yo soy todo un chef
Tengo sexo 24/7 todo el mes

Puedo soplar las nubes grises pa' que tengas un buen da
Tambin s como comunicarme por telepata
Por ti, cruzo las fronteras sin visa
Y le saco una buena sonrisa a la Mona Lisa

Por ti, respiro antes de morirme
Por ti voy a la Iglesia y escucho toda la misa sin dormirme
Sigo siendo el rey, aunque no tenga reino
Mi sudor huele a perfume y nunca me despeino

S pelear todas las artes marciales
Tambin se como comunicarme con los animales
Mientras ms pasa el tiempo me veo ms joven
Esta cancin la compuse sin escuchar como Beethoven

Try to tear us apart but know that we'll wear our scars

[Verse 1]
Excuses, excuses are all that I hear
All I can see when I look in the mirror
I can?t escape all these thoughts in my mind, they?re waiting to haunt me
Night after night

[Verse 2]
I feel it in my bones and everything I know
It?s underneath my skin and it won?t let go
They know me all too well, but only time will tell
If this is who I am, do I know myself?

Don?t forget your life?s your own, don?t ever let it go

You're crashin' and burnin', when life?s at its coldest

Denial, Denial is all that I?ve known
Holding me hostage I?m never alone
I?m fighting for air, I fight to survive
My soul?s not for sale I won?t pay the price

Huh huh huh hu-uh huh
Huh huh huh hu-uh huh

[Verse 1]
So true funny how it seems
Always in time, but never in line for dreams
Head over heels when toe to toe
This is the sound of my soul
This is the sound
I bought a ticket to the world
But now I've come back again
Why do I find it hard to write the next line
Oh I want the truth to be said

[Verse 2]
With a thrill in my head and a pill on my tongue
Dissolve the nerves that have just begun
Listening to Marvin (all night long)
This is the sound of my soul
This is the sound
Always slipping from my hands
Sand's a time of its own
Take your seaside arms and write the next line
Oh I want the truth to be known

When life leaves you high and dry
I'll be at your door tonight
If you need help, if you need help
I'll shut down the city lights
I'll lie, cheat, I'll beg and bribe
To make you well, to make you well

I'll carry you away from war
If you need help, if you need help
Your hope dangling by a string
I'll share in your suffering
To make you well, to make you well

Put you on your feet, you on your feet

You're my cornerstone
You're my crutch when my legs stop moving
You're my head start

Not with the James, not the Jim, but the Bobby Brown
Now I'm chilling much harder as you all know
Cause Bobby Brown was good to good to good to go solo
Been on the microphone a long long time
I'm guaranteed to bust a stupid rhyme
Now I'm on the mic and I'm rocking real fresher
Everybody out there don't talk less about me
Cause I'm rocking it steady
And when I'm on the mic, don't you dare call me Freddy
Cause I'm ready to really get paid
And if anybody steps in my way they getting slayed
My name is Brown, that's what they call me,
Yes, I drive a 560 SEC
And when I'm on the mic, you gotta see me
Driving down the block cause I'm blocking and locking
When the sucker M.C.'s trying to drop my spot
When I'm rocking on the microphone
People gotta gotta gotta gotta leave me alone
Cause I really don't care, really don't give a damn

Pull off in that Lambo
Burnin' rubber and my eyes low (bitch, back the fuck up)
I tell her she can fuck up my life
Just don't fuck up my cash flow
Walk up in this bitch, Louis, Gucci, lil Prada
Went from none to somethin', been like tada

Days when the rains came
Down in the hollow

To Tuesday and so slow
Going down the old mine
With a transistor radio
Standing in the sunlight laughing
Hiding behind a rainbow's wall

Behind the stadium with you

And washed it away down the kitchen sink

Are you progressing work?
We're all a worth to process
How do you process your worth?

I went from H.I. to Playwrite
Unsavory crass piercings
To favoring rap lyrics
From raw stunts to AllOne
Depraved with my lashed skin
And burnt flaming hands in cinema
To cadence and fast rhythms
The aims of my past switching
From Johnny Knoxville (breaking my back living)
To Tennessee Williams
A beast with language of vast tinting
Menagerie glass prisms
Slave to the craft written
Note the factor: no matter
The PLACE of my ambition
My brain isn't stagnant
In a STATE of it's transition
Creative and grand visions
Hurricane and wingspan kissing
It's The Butterfly Effect
I was crazed in the beginning but then I tried to vent it
Dependent on making up planned fiction
With a wonder I invent
Now I'm clear-headed with ambiguous sad images
As how Shutter Island ended
And whenever I'm progressive, I accept it it's expected

We're all a work in progress
Are you progressing work?
We're all a worth to process
How do you process your worth?

Ideally I wish I'd whisper sweet nothings in your ears
But really I'll just speak so much you'll wish I wasn't there
My heart isn't encased in any sort of picture frame
It ripped the cage and slipped away, much like the Grinch's eh?
It's got a resting ridiculous rate of a thousand words a minute pace
And my words tend to escape me unexpectedly intense and insanely!
My birthday cards get lengthy and mushy quickly
Crammed cramped confessionals encouraging fulfilling living
They say more than most parents to their kids by fifty
It's to make up for not seeing you enough because I'm busy
And simply to amend that I'm too broke for gift giving
Silly and interesting, I scrawl em on the way home from the gift shop
My Kodak moment is the cutting-room-floor of Hitchcock
Most of my favorite clothing is thrift bought and more often than not
I get depressed instead of pissed off!
I'm just not the guy whose going to yell at you if we're fighting
It's actually unexciting: I'll talk rationally and nicely
'til you ask me to leave brightening, since I'm not dramatically enticing
""Where's the passion where's the lightening?""
Honestly
I find conflict frightening
And I'd rather tell you that I was wrong and that I hate myself in writing
Than turn beat red and pretend that I know the right thing
And whenever I'm rejected, I accept it, it's expected

We're all a work in progress
Are you progressing work?
We're all a worth to process
How do you process your worth?

Chrono-miser (afraid to waste time) as I spend
It's directly affecting my self-worth and value
Taxing my connections to fulfill personal objectives
Unable to find a balance and so I'm left in a deficit
Depressing. We've got all this baggage, but we ain't going anywhere
Take my leave of absence, can't move on I see you everywhere
So I take the pen(pin) out, feeling explosive (like a grenadier)
The last several years, regrets and fears exes spear through the middle
(like an asterisk) had you on my arm, as that tattoo is
You had to skip, now you're only on my mind, show me there's a sign
Totally despite supporters in my corner, I've been lonely in my life
There's a pulling in my throat, every breath I take
Heart is overworked, shackled by a heavy weight
Pressure behind my eyes like when a levy breaks
Wishing there's a penny placed there almost every day
My lips twitch, itching to frown, at any given minute now
I'll be six in the ground. Roots writhing around
We went from two peas within a pod to ruined beans that sit and rot
I choose to scream at mythic monstrous dubiously existent gods
Ship or water. Lip or dock. You never know the role you're cast...

But here's a perfect mess, falling out of that dress
Take a drunk girl home

[Chorus]
Take a drunk girl home
Let her sleep all alone
Leave her keys on the counter your number by the phone
Pick up her life she threw on the floor
Leave the hall lights on walk out and lock the door
That's how she knows the difference between a boy and man
Take a drunk girl home

[Verse 2]
You leave her drive for a dive and you get something bad to eat
They're singing ""Closing Time"" at that bar across the street
In two by twos, strangers and lovers headed for the covers, hooking up
That TV in your two bedroom sounds turned off
And through the paper-thin walls, you can hear the neighbor?s cigarette cough
There's a million things you could be doing, but there's one thing you're sure damn glad you did

[Chorus]
Take a drunk girl home
Let her sleep all alone
Leave her keys on the counter your number by the phone
Pick up her life she threw on the floor
Leave the hall lights on walk out and lock the door
That's how she knows the difference between a boy and man
Take a drunk girl home

[Chorus 2]
Took a drunk girl home
In the sober light of dawn
She left you a message she thanks you on the phone
Cause you picked up her life she threw on the floor
You left the hall lights on walked out and lock edthe door
That's how she knows the difference between a boy and man
Take a drunk girl home

You take a drunk girl home

Closed off from love, I didn't need the pain
Once or twice was enough and it was all in vain
Time starts to pass, before you know it you're frozen
But something happened for the very first time with you
My heart melted to the ground
Found something true
And everyone's looking round thinking I'm going crazy

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

[Chorus]
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

[Verse 2]
Trying hard not to hear, but they talk so loud
Their piercing sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that their goal is to keep me from falling
But nothing's greater than the risk
That comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness, I see your face
Yet everyone around me thinks that I'm going crazy
Maybe, maybe

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth

It won't let go of me

We don't believe you 'cause we the people
Are still here in the rear, ayo, we don't need you
You in the killing-off-good-young-nigga mood
When we get hungry we eat the same fucking food
The ramen noodle
Your simple voodoo is so maniacal, we're liable to pull a juju
The irony is that this bad bitch in my lap
She don't love me, she make money, she don't study that
She gon' give it to me, ain't gon' tell me run it back
She gon' take the brain to wetter plains, she spit on that
The doors have signs with, don't try to rhyme with
VH1 has a show that you can waste your time with
Guilty pleasures take the edge off reality
And for a salary I'd probably do that shit sporadically
The OG Gucci boots are smitten with iguanas
The IRS piranha see a nigga gettin' commas
Niggas in the hood living in a fishbowl
Gentrify here, now it's not a shit hole
Trendsetter, I know, my shit's cold
Ain't settling because I ain't so bold but ay

All you Black folks, you must go
All you Mexicans, you must go
And all you poor folks, you must go
Muslims and gays, boy, we hate your ways
So all you bad folks, you must go

[Bridge: Phife Dawg & Q-Tip]
The fog and the smog of news media that logs
False narratives of Gods that came up against the odds
We're not just nigga rappers with the bars
It's kismet that we're cosmic with the stars

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
You bastards overlooking street art
Better yet, street smarts but you keep us off the charts
So motherfuck your numbers and your statisticians
Fuck y'all know about true competition?
That's like a AL pitcher on deck talking about he hittin'
The only one who's hitting are the ones that's currently spittin'
We got your missy smitten rubbing on her little kitten
Dreaming of a world that's equal for women with no division
Boy, I tell you that's vision
Like Tony Romo when he hitting Witten
The Tribe be the best in they division
Shaheed Muhammad cut it with precision
Who can come back years later, still hit the shot?
Still them tryna move we off the fucking block
Babylon, bloodclaat
Two pon yuh headtop

Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start

They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me

Yeah, she's a triflin' friend indeed

[Verse 1]
Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said: ""I can tell you rock, I can tell by your charm
Far as girls, you got a flock
I can tell by your charm and your arm.""
But I'm lookin' for the one, have you seen her?
My psychic told me she'll have a ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids
And I gotta take all they bad asses to ShowBiz?
Okay, get your kids, but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in
We all went to din' and then I had to pay
If you fuckin' with this girl, then you better be paid
You know why? It take too much to touch her
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
My best friend said she used to fuck with Usher
I don't care what none of y'all say, I still love her

[Verse 2]
Eighteen years, eighteen years
She got one of your kids, got you for eighteen years
I know somebody payin' child support for one of his kids
His baby mama car and crib is bigger than his
You will see him on TV any given Sunday
Win the Super Bowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was supposed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money
She went to the doctor, got lipo with your money
She walkin' around lookin' like Michael with your money
Shoulda got that insured, Geico for your money
If you ain't no punk
Holla, ""We want prenup! We want prenup!"" (Yeah!)
It's somethin' that you need to have
?Cause when she leave yo' ass, she gon' leave with half
Eighteen years, eighteen years
And on the 18th birthday he found out it wasn't his?!

You don't want a dude to smoke but he can't buy weed
You go out to eat, he can't pay, y'all can't leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves
But while y'all washin', watch him
He gon' make it to a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition, baby, look at his eyes
This week he moppin' floors, next week it's the fries
So stick by his side
I know there's dudes ballin', and yeah, that's nice
And they gonna keep callin' and tryin', but you stay right, girl
And when you get on, he'll leave yo' ass for a white girl

Man, I hate rap, but if the shoe fits, wear it
I've become a freak of nature all the kids stare at
Who walk around bumpin' Raw with the shit blarin'
Saying ""Fuck school!"" and droppin' out like a miscarriage
I'm embarrassed and I'm ashamed
I played a part in this devilish game
Makin' your common sense perish
But I ain't takin' the full blame, ?cause most of you chumps runnin' around here ain't never had strict parents
All of your brain cells rottin' from weed
You feelin' like if you ain't got it, life's not as complete
You havin' sex with every-motherfuckin'-body you see
With a past so dark that Satan'd jump out of his seat
But still you out in these streets, thinkin' you hot as can be
Without the knowledge to lead, so you just follow the sheep
Makin' sure your lame swag is all polished and clean
While your favorite rapper's like, ""Yeah, he got it from me.""
You been brainwashed by a fake life that you're used to livin'
When I say the word ""fun,"" what do you envision?
Probably drinkin' and smokin' out with your crew and chillin'
With clueless women you tryin' to bang, bumpin' New Edition
Is that all you think life really is?
Well, if so, then you're a fuckin' idiot
I honestly feel like grabbing your head and hitting it
Matter of fact, you don't even deserve a brain ? give me it!
Do you even have any goals
Aside from baggin' these hoes and packin' a bowl?
Well, let me guess ? no
You're only in school because your parents make you go
When all you do is play beer pong and hang out with the bros
Yo, society's got you livin' for a whack cause
You're a fuckin' adult with no skills at all
You don't read any books or play ball
You don't draw ? you literally do nothing at all!
Still you fiend for the glamorous fruits
You don't have, ?cause you idolize rappers that do
And all they say is, ""I got money and it's stacked to the roof.""
And now you think that it's gon' magically just happen to you?
How? Your lazy ass don't commit to labor
You pick somethin' up, try it out, and put it down two minutes later
Then you complain about your life ?cause it ain't gettin' catered
Now whoever tries to call you on your bullshit's a hater?
You wanna succeed, you have to try; or one day you'll get older
And regret it all ?cause you can't provide
Your friends are lowlives, don't act surprised
Look, just cut the bad fruit off of the tree, make the sacrifice

[Verse 2]
Girls, stop actin' like you want a guy
With traits like Romeo ? bitch, that's a fuckin' lie!
You always talk about how every man's fake and you can't take it
And you want somethin' real ? shut up, tramp, save it!
Twice a week you put on your makeup and damn bracelets
And head to the club half-naked with your ass shakin'
Pullin' a lowlife nigga who claim he cash-makin'
'Til you let him hit and find out he work at the gas station
One of them niggas got you pregnant and you can't raise it
But you caused it, your actions made a fat statement
You want Romeo, then act patient
And stop frontin' like he in the club posted in the back waitin'
It's the club, where guys put on a new persona
After they get loaded with a few Corona's
They always shoutin' and wild out
With habits that very few condone of
Then they look for beautiful brainless bitches like you to bone 'em
Then when they leave you, you cry and cry
Talkin' about, ""Oh my god, I can't find a guy!
I've spent so many years and I've tried and tried!
Why am I even on Earth? I should die!""
You want Romeo, you're not worthy
You're cock-thirsty, you're nasty and probably got herpes
Sometimes the secret to finding is to stop searching
Try a new formula, ?cause your last one's not working

[Verse 3]
The term ""real nigga"" is publicly used
And I need to know what it means, ?cause I'm fuckin' confused
Are you one for always bustin' your tool
With nothin' to lose and somethin' to prove
To homies up in your crew?
Is it because you're sellin' drugs to get loot
And brag about how you done been shot and stabbed
Like it's fun to be you?
But your life's a struggle, right, and you just hustlin' through?
Nah, you hamster-ass nigga, you just stuck in a loop
Man, why do black people gotta be the only ones who can't evolve? ?Cause you in the streets actin' like a neanderthal
It's clear you can't stand the law
You're lost as an abandoned dog
And all you're interested in is fightin', rappin' and basketball
I can't even fuck with you
?Cause if we out in public, you gon' get caught stealin' some shit, and get my ass in trouble, too
You'll get old and be nothin'
Livin' life in these streets, thuggin'
And starting shit with anybody mean-muggin'
Look at you, a real nigga, thinkin' your life's cool
Girls used to turn me down for guys who were like you
'Til you grab their heart and shove a spearhead right through
Then they regret it because it wasn't the right move
Your ""real nigga"" talk seems bogus
A real nigga don't brag about being real as long as he knows it
And his future doesn't seem hopeless
A real nigga stays out of jail, handles shit and he keeps focused

[Verse 4]
To all you rappers whose soul is out in the wrong
You inspired the issue I wrote about in this song
You go to prowl on the young who roam around in the slums
See, this is what happens when rap's overcrowded with bums
Hope the hour is long when I'm rollin' out with your tongue
The man above is my guide, you know the power is strong
All you menacin' freaks are only in it for cheese
And the mass-control limit was breached ? fuck hip-hop!
They only in it for cheese, and any eyewitness can see
They purposely makin' the innocent weak
My existence on this planet's for you, I ain't only here to benefit me
Yo, we need to make a change while there's still time
It is hard, and sometimes I struggle tryin' to reveal mine
I can guide you if you feel blind
I just need you to be willin' to journey into my ill mind","man hate rap shoe fit wear become freak nature kid stare walk around bumpin raw shit blarin say fuck school droppin like miscarriage embarrass ashamed play part devilish game makin common sense perish takin full blame cause much chump runnin around never strict parent brain cell rottin wee feelin like get lifes complete havin sex every motherfuckin body see past dark satand jump seat still street thinkin hot can without knowledge lead just follow sheep makin sure lame swag polish clean favorite rappers like yes get brainwash fake life use livin say word fun envision probably drinkin smokin crow chillin clueless woman tryin bang bumpin new edition think life really good fuckin idiot honestly feel like grab head hit matter fact even deserve brain give even goal aside baggin hoe packin bowl good let guess school parent make go play beer pong hang bros yo societys get livin whack cause fuckin adult skill read book play ball draw literally nothing still fiend glamorous fruit cause idolize rappers say get money stack roof now think gon magically just happen lazy ass commit labor pick somethin try put two minute late complain life cause gettin cater now whoever try call bullsh hater wanna succeed try one day will get old regret cause can provide friend lowlives act surprise look just cut bad fruit tree make sacrifice girl stop actin like want guy trait like romeo bitch fuckin lie always talk every mans fake can take want somethin real shut tramp save twice week put makeup damn bracelet head club half naked ass shakin pullin lowlife nigga claim cash makin let hit find work gas station one niggas get pregnant can raise cause action make fat statement want romeo act patient stop frontin like club post back waitin club guy put new persona get load coronas always shoutin wild habit condone look beautiful brainless bitch like bone leave cry cry talkin oh god can find guy spend many year try try even earth die want romeo worthy cock thirsty nasty probably get herpes sometimes secret find stop search try new formula cause last ones work term real nigga publicly use need know mean cause fuckin confuse one always bustin tool nothin lose somethin prove homies crow sellin drug get loot brag shoot stab like fun lifes struggle right just hustlin nah hamster ass nigga just stick loop man black people gotta one can evolve cause street actin like neanderthal clear can stand law lose abandon dog interest fightin rappin basketball can even fuck cause public gon get catch stealin shit get ass trouble will get old nothin livin life street thuggin start shit anybody mean muggin look real nigga thinkin lifes cool girl use turn guy like grab heart shove spearhead right regret right move real nigga talk seem bogus real nigga brag real long know future seem hopeless real nigga stay jail handle shit keep focus rappers whose soul wrong inspire issue write song go prowl young roam around slum see happen raps overcrowd bum hope hour long rollin tongue man guide know power strong menacin freak cheese mass control limit breach fuck hip hop cheese eyewitness can see purposely makin innocent weak existence planets benefit yo need make change still time hard sometimes struggle tryin reveal mine can guide feel blind just need willin journey ill mind","rap","all",556,-1.04327238350636,"c(""like"", ""like"", ""hot"", ""lead"", ""clean"", ""favorite"", ""like"", ""fun"", ""good"", ""like"", ""good"", ""skill"", ""glamorous"", ""idolize"", ""succeed"", ""like"", ""like"", ""work"", ""patient"", ""like"", ""beautiful"", ""like"", ""worthy"", ""work"", ""like"", ""fun"", ""right"", ""like"", ""clear"", ""cool"", ""like"", ""right"", ""right"", ""inspire"", ""strong"", ""benefit"")","c(""hate"", ""freak"", ""shit"", ""fuck"", ""embarrass"", ""ashamed"", ""devilish"", ""perish"", ""blame"", ""strict"", ""dark"", ""lame"", ""brainwash"", ""fake"", ""clueless"", ""idiot"", ""hang"", ""fiend"", ""lazy"", ""complain"", ""hater"", ""regret"", ""bad"", ""bitch"", ""lie"", ""fake"", ""tramp"", ""damn"", ""fat"", ""wild"", ""brainless"", ""bitch"", ""cry"", ""cry"", ""die"", ""nasty"", ""confuse"", ""lose"", ""loot"", ""stab"", ""struggle"", ""lose"", ""fuck"", ""shit"", ""trouble"", ""shit"", ""regret"", ""bogus"", ""hopeless"", ""shit"", ""wrong"", ""issue"", ""bum"", ""freak"", ""limit"",

But still everybody plays

Believing all of the rumors

I got a friend who's been thinkin' 'bout
Finally kickin' her husband out
His second life as a talent scout
Finally got him caught

She heard a voice from beyond the throes
""Punish him for the life he chose
""But forgive the past that he did not!""

It's really hard to hate anyone
When you know what they've lived through
And once they've given you a taste
She said, ""This is for you to overcome
""But I will always love you""
In her perfect state of grace

On the banks of some great divide
Two versions of a dream

You must think that I'm new to this
But I have seen this all before

[Refrain]
I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

[Pre-Chorus]
And every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true

I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)

[Verse 2]
I know you're thinkin' I'm heartless
I know you're thinkin' I'm cold
I'm just protectin' my innocence
I'm just protectin' my soul

[Refrain]
I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

[Pre-Chorus]
And every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you

[Chorus]
I'm way to good at goodbyes
(I'm way to good at goodbyes)
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
No way that you'll see me cry
(No way that you'll see me cry)

Am I throwing you off?
Nope
Didn't think so

[Verse 1: Nelly Furtado & Timbaland]
How you doing, young lady?
That feeling that you giving really drives me crazy
You don't have a player on the truck
I was at a loss of words first time that we spoke
You looking for a girl that'll treat you right
You looking for her in the daytime, with the light
You might be the type if I play my cards right
I'll find out by the end of the night
You expect me to just let you hit it
But will you still respect me if you get it
All I can do is try, gimme one chance
What's the problem, I don't see no ring on your hand
I'll be the first to admit it
I'm curious about you, you seem so innocent
You wanna' get in my world, get lost in it
Boy, I'm tired of running, let's walk for a minute

[Hook: Timbaland and Nelly Furtado]
Promiscuous girl, wherever you are
I'm all alone, and it's you that I want
Promiscuous boy, you already know
That I'm all yours, what you waiting for?
Promiscuous girl, you're teasing me
You know what I want, and I got what you need
Promiscuous boy, let's get to the point
Cause we're on a roll, you ready?

[Verse 2: Nelly Furtado & Timbaland]
Roses are red, some diamonds are blue
Chivalry is dead, but you're still kinda cute
Hey! I can't keep my mind off you
Where you at, do you mind if I come through?
I'm out of this world come with me to my planet
Get you on my level, do you think that you can handle it?
They call me Thomas, last name Crown
Recognize game, Imma' lay mine's down
I'm a big girl I can handle myself but if I get lonely I might need your help
Pay attention to me, I don't talk for my health
I want you on my team
So does everybody else
SHH! Baby we can keep it on the low
Let your guard down ain't nobody gotta know
If you with it girl I know a place we can go
What kind of girl do you take me for?

Hey! Don't be mad, don't get mean
Don't get mad, don't be mean

[Verse 3: Nelly Furtado & Timbaland]
Wait...I don't mean no harm
I can see you with my t-shirt on
I can see you with nothing on
Feeling on me before you bring that on
Bring that on?!
You know what I mean
Girl, I'm a freak you shouldn't say those things!
I'm only trying to get inside of your brain
To see if you can work me the way you say
It's okay, it's alright
I got something that you gon' like
Hey, is that the truth or are you talking trash?
Is your game M.V.P. like Steve Nash?

[Intro: Juicy J]
Yeah ya'll know what it is
Katy Perry, Juicy J
Uh huh, let's rage!

[Verse 1: Katy Perry]
I knew you were, you were gonna come to me
And here you are, but you better choose carefully
'Cause I, I'm capable of anything
Of anything, and everything
Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your one and only
But don't make me your enemy
Your enemy, your enemy

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're falling for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm?
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back

[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
Mark my words, this love will make you levitate
Like a bird, like a bird without a cage
We're down to earth if you choose to walk away
Don't walk away
It's in the palm of your hand now, baby
It's a yes or a no, no maybe
So just be sure before you give it all to me
All to me, give it all to me

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're falling for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse

A perfect storm, perfect storm?
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
She's a beast, I call her Karma
She eat your heart out like Jeffrey Dahmer
Be careful, try not to lead her on
Shawty's heart is on steroids, 'cause her love is so strong
You may fall in love when you meet her
If you get the chance, you better keep her
She's sweet as pie, but if you break her heart
She turn cold as a freezer
That fairy tale ending with a knight in shining armor
She can be my sleeping beauty, I'm gon' put her in a coma (Woo!)
Damn, I think I love her, shawty's so bad, I'm sprung and I don't care
She ride me like a roller coaster, turn the bedroom into a fair
Her love is like a drug, I was tryna hit it and quit it
But lil mama so dope, I messed around and got addicted

She waited on me (then what?)
Shawty cakin' on me, got the bacon on me (wait up)

'Cause who's counting anyway
Won't stop till the job is done

She pretends she doesn't see

First thing's first, I'm the realest
Drop this and let the whole world feel it
And I'm still in the Murda Bizness
I could hold you down, like I'm givin' lessons in physics
You should want a bad bitch like this
Drop it low and pick it up just like this
Cup of Ace, cup of Goose, cup of Cris
High heels, somethin' worth a half a ticket on my wrist
Takin' all the liquor straight, never chase that
Rooftop like we bringin' '88 back
Bring the hooks in, where the bass at?
Champagne spillin', you should taste that

I said, ""Baby, I do this, I thought that you knew this.""
Can't stand no haters and honest, the truth is
And my flow retarded, they speak it depart it
Swagger on super, I can't shop at no department
Better get my money on time, if they not money, decline
And swear I meant that there so much that they give that line a rewind
So get my money on time, if they not money, decline
I just can't worry 'bout no haters, gotta stay on my grind
Now tell me, who that, who that? That do that, do that?
Put that paper over all, I thought you knew that, knew that

Trash the hotel
Let's get drunk on the mini bar
Make the phone call
Feels so good getting what I want
Yeah, keep on turning it up
Chandelier swinging, we don't give a fuck
Film star, yeah I'm deluxe
Classic, expensive, you don't get to touch
Still stuntin', how you love that?
Got the whole world asking how I does that
Hot girl, hands off, don't touch that
Look at it I bet you wishing you could clutch that
It's just the way you like it, huh?
You're so good, he's just wishing he could bite it, huh?
Never turn down nothing,
Slaying these hoes, gold trigger on the gun like

Guess what I did today
Those were the words I said to you
It was last may, dont know the exact day

So I asked you would you do me
The honor of being my wife

I will be your man
Your protector, your best friend
Till my humble life is ended
And time begins again, couldn't we be...

My love is oh so strong
Couldn't we be happily ever after?
Couldn't we be?

[Verse 2]
When I was away, mmm, mmm
Some friends became just faces
Some people grew apart
But you stayed right in my heart
And so many times
Pictured this day inside my mind
And for so many years, ooh
I knew it would be you here with me, oh

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Yes I will
Take you for my wife
The center of my life
And I will never, ever fade
From this choice I made, oh

Couldn't we be happily ever after?
C'mon

Said my love is strong
Couldn't we be happily ever after?
Couldn't we be, babe?

No no, Hey yeah

You don't have to look no further than me
Don't look no more, baby yeah
You don't need much more than my lovin' to make you happy

Barbarisms by Barbaras
With pointed heels
Victorious, Victorians, kneel
For brand new spanking deals
Marching forward hypocritic
And hypnotic computers
You depend on our protection
Yet you feed us lies from the table cloth

Kneeling roses disappearing
Into Moses' dry mouth
Breaking into Fort Knox

Handed to obsoletion
Still you feed us lies from the table cloth

There are many ways to deal with this pain

I know that it's difficult
I'm stackin' this paper, it's sort of habitual
I blow the residual
And fuckin' yo bitch like its part of my ritual
Pardon the visual
But money, it give me a hard-on it's typical
I want it in physical
A million dollars, I count up in intervals
Without it I'm miserable
Don't wanna fall off so I'm all in my bag
Thankin' God like it's biblical
I know it's gon' solve every problem I have
I balled on the principal
Remember the teachers was all on my ass
Now look all of them, pitiful
And all of a sudden I'm so good at math

Proceed with caution
I heard if you chase it only results in
A hole in your heart
Fuck it, I take the whole cake and I won't leave a portion
It's only an organ

The loneliest orphan
I flip my misfortune and grow me a fortune
My Rollie is scorchin'
Them niggas that hated is slowly endorsin'
Now Cole, he important
My niggas beside me like Tommy and Martin
We ball on your court and
Then skate with your bitch like we Tonya Harding

And soy milk's out of stock

It's a new thing, check out this I bring
Uh, oh, the roll below the level, 'cause I'm livin' low
Next to the bass, (C'mon!), turn up the radio

The enemy could be their friend, guardian
I'm not a hooligan, I rock the party and
Clear all the madness, I'm not a racist
Preach to teach to all ('Cause, some, they never had this)
Number one, not born to run, about the gun
I wasn't licensed to have one
The minute they see me, fear me
I'm the epitome, of ""public enemy""
Used, abused without clues
I refuse to blow a fuse

[Verse 2]
""Yes"" was the start of my last jam
So here it is again, another def jam
But since I gave you all a little something that I knew you lacked
They still consider me a new jack
All the critics you can hang 'em, I'll hold the rope
But they hope to the Pope, and pray it ain't dope
The follower of Farrakhan
Don't tell me that you understand until you hear the man
The book of the new school rap game
Writers treat me like Coltrane, insane
Yes to them, but to me I'm a different kind
We're brothers of the same mind, unblind
Caught in the middle and not surrendering
I don't rhyme for the sake of riddling
Some claim that I'm a smuggler
Some say I never heard of ya, a rap burglar
False media, we don't need it do we?
(It's fake that's what it be to ya, dig me?
Yo, Terminator X, step up on the stand

[Verse 3]
Don't believe the hype, it's a sequel
As an equal can I get this through to you
My '98 booming with a trunk of funk
All the jealous punks can't stop the dunk
Coming from the school of hard knocks
Some perpetrate, they drink Clorox
Attack the Black, because I know they lack exact
The cold facts, and still they try to Xerox
The leader of the new school, uncool
Never played the fool, just made the rules
Remember there's a need to get alarmed
Again I said I was a time bomb
In the daytime radio's scared of me
Cause I'm mad, plus I'm the enemy
They can't come on and play me in prime time
Cause I know the time, cause I'm getting mine
I get on the mix late in the night
They know I'm living right, so here go the mic?sike
Before I let it go, don't rush my show
You try to reach and grab and get elbowed
Word to Herb, yo if you can't swing this
Learn the words, you might sing this
Just a little bit of the taste of the bass for you
As you get up and dance at the LQ
When some deny it, defy it, I swing Bolos
And then they clear the lane I go solo
The meaning of all of that, some media is the wack
As you believe it's true
It blows me through the roof
Suckers, liars, get me a shovel
Some writers I know are damn devils
For them I say, don't believe the hype
(Yo, Chuck, they must be on the pipe, right?)
Their pens and pads I'll snatch cause I've had it
I'm not a addict fiending for static
I'll see their tape recorder and I grab it
(No, you can't have it back, silly rabbit)
I'm going to my media assassin, Harry Allen?I gotta ask him
(Yo, Harry, you're a writer?are we that type?)
(Don't believe the hype)

[Verse 4]
I got Flavor and all those things, you know
(Yeah, boy, part two bum rush the show)
Yo Griff get the green, black and red, and
Gold down, countdown to Armageddon
'88 you wait the S1's will
Put the left in effect and I still will
Rock the hard jams, treat it like a seminar
Reach the bourgeois and rock the boulevard
Some say I'm negative, but they're not positive
But what I got to give, (The media says this?)
Red, black, and green, you know what I mean?

[Outro: Flavor Flav]
Yo, don't believe that hype
They got to be beaming that pipe, you know what I'm saying?
Yo, them Megas got 'em going up to see Captain Kirk
Like a jerk and they outta work
Let me tell you a little something, man;
A lot of people on daytime radio scared of us
Because they too ignorant to understand the lyrics of the
Truth that we pumping into them clogged up brain cells
That just spun their little wooden skulls they call caps
You know what I'm saying?
But the S1s'll straighten it out quick-fast, in a hurry
Don't worry, Flavor vision ain't blurry, you know what I'm saying?
Yo, Terminator X

Just before our love got lost you said
""I am as constant as a northern star""
And I said, ""Constant in the darkness
Where's that at?
If you want me I'll be in the bar""
On the back of a cartoon coaster
In the blue TV screen light
I drew a map of Canada
Oh, Canada
With your face sketched on it twice

[Chorus]
Oh, you are in my blood like holy wine
You taste so bitter and so sweet
Oh, I could drink a case of you, darling
And I would still be on my feet
Oh, I would still be on my feet

[Verse 2]
Oh, I am a lonely painter
I live in a box of paints
I'm frightened by the devil
And I'm drawn to those ones that ain't afraid
I remember that time you told me, you said
""Love is touching souls""
Surely you touched mine
'Cause part of you pours out of me
In these lines from time to time

[Chorus]
Oh, you are in my blood like holy wine
You taste so bitter and so sweet
Oh, I could drink a case of you, darling
Still I'd be on my feet
I would still be on my feet

[Verse 3]
I met a woman
She had a mouth like yours
She knew your life
She knew your devils and your deeds
And she said
""Go to him, stay with him if you can
But be prepared to bleed""

[Chorus]

Sorry

[Verse 1]
These mistakes, I?ve made my fair share
When you needed me, I wasn?t there
I was young, I was dumb, I was so immature
And the things that I did made you so insecure
But baby, I?m still your man, I swear

Can we start over? (Can we start over?) Can we end this war?

But is there still a chance of me changing your mind?
Before you (yeah) go walking out the door

Burned down their hanging trees

The bite that binds the gift that gives

Where we did our first drugs

Tryna steal up my zapatos

Rolling through my neighborhood
Must've been a Sunday
Caddy with the bench seats

Cigarillos rolled
The Boston's in the back make it sound so sweet
The dropped Cadillac will make you dance to the beat

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
You could have it your way, how do you want it?
You gonna back that thing up or should I push up on it?
Temperature rising, okay, let's go to the next level
Dance floor jam packed, hot as a tea kettle
I break it down for you now, baby, it's simple
If you be a nympho, I be a nympho
In the hotel or in the back of the rental
On the beach or in the park, it's whatever you into
Got the magic stick, I'm the love doctor
Have your friends teasing you about how sprung I got you
When you show me what you working, baby, no problem
Get on top, get your bounce around like a low rider
I'm a seasoned vet when it come to this shit
After you work up a sweat, you could play with the stick
I'm trying to explain, baby, the best way I can
I melt in your mouth, girl, not in your hand (uh huh)

Give it to me, baby, nice and slow
Climb on top, ride like you in a rodeo
You ain't never heard a sound like this before
?Cause I ain't never put it down like this
Soon as I come through the door
She kept pulling on my zipper
It's like a race, who can get undressed quicker
Isn't it ironic, how erotic it is to watch her in thongs?
Had me thinking about that ass after I'm gone
I touched the right spot at the right time
Lights on or lights off, she like it from behind
So seductive, you should see the way she whine
Her hips in slow-mo on the floor when we grind
Long as she ain't stoppin', homie, and I ain't stoppin'
Dripping wet with sweat, man, it's on and poppin'
All my champagne campaign, bottle after bottle, it's on

On your knees in them Prada's
Makin' freaky shit come up out her

[Hook: Jeremih]
Get high baby, roll one
Cloud nine 'bout to go up
Lovin' the feelin' the turbulence get when we turn up
When we land we can roll out
Show you somethin' you ain't know 'bout
Tonight we be takin' off flight with a camera to show out

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
You need a nigga that's gon' come over and dig you out
You need a nigga that you know is not gon' run his mouth
You need a nigga when he done probably gon' put you out
You need a nigga that's gon' put it in your mouth
Dick so big it's like a foot is in yo' mouth
And you ain't babysittin', but my kids all on yo' couch
And oh, you nasty, oh, oh, you nasty
Both graduated so fuck keepin' it classy
Look, they love me in the Chi like MJ
They love me in the Chi like Oprah
No nigga could block, not even Dikembe
Compared to Cole, boy, you're softer than a sofa
And so far my new shit's so fire, nigga, check my profile
Who you know make waves in the low tide?
Deebo'ed yo' bitch, now she both ours
Nigga, little brown liquor in my liver
Pretty brown thing in my bed
Been a long time since I had to ask for head
So goddamn, don't make me beg
But I will if I need to, 'cause for real, girl, I need you
I could put you on a flight, we could take off tonight
If you scared of heights, shit, I got a pill I could feed you

True blue when I bust
Leavin' bodies hangin' like the tongue of my chucks

I'm smoking everybody nigga bitches and all
Stretch 'em out in broad daylight muthafuck the witnesses

Fucked a famous girl to ""Mask Off"" (Molly, Percocet)
Pop a bean an' let the bags talk
Bought ten bottles on a last call (last call)
Flew a basic girl out from Alaska
Illegal alien inside my spaceship
Two Cs on my shoes, these not no ASICS
Get out my face, my pockets full of faces
Bust down gold AP, that's not no stainless (yahh)
My Rollie told me what the day is

Her followers 100k, then she too famous
If she got a thousand, might make her my main bitch, yeah

I put my lifetime in between the paper's lines
I'm the quiet storm nigga who fight rhyme
P, yeah, you heard of him, but I ain't concerned with them
Nigga, I pop more guns than you holdin' them
Make my route while the sun's out and scold your men
Unload ten in broad daylight, get right
Fuck your life! Hop on my '98 dirt bike
You try to stop mines from growin'
I'll make your blood stop flowin'
Take affirmative action, to any ass if he askin'
Now here come the MAC-10
You's a dick blower, tryin' to speak the Dunn language
What the drilly with that though? It ain't bangin'

Lyin' to the Pop Dog like you got it

Yo, the P rock forty inch cables, drinkin' white label
My chain hang down to my dick, my piece bang glass tables
Diamonds and guns before the fame, duke
A nigga like me hold TEC's, are you the same too?
Goin' through the emotions of gun holdin'
Long shotgun's down my pants leg, limpin'
Killa B, you still livin', even my pops too
He taught me how to shoot when I was seven
I used to bust shots crazy, I couldn't even look
Because the loud sound used to scare me
I love my pops for that, I love my niggaty Black
I'll take the life of anybody tryin' to change what's left
And through all of that a nigga ain't scared of death
All y'all brand new niggas just scared to death
I spent too many nights sniffin' coke, gettin' right
Wastin' my life, now I'm tryin' to make things right
Grand open some gates, invest in the rag business
Do things for the kids, the little Dunns
Build a jungle gym behind the crib, so they can enjoy youth
CBR's and VCR's, ATV's and big screen TV's
Nigga, please don't make me have to risk my freedom
We worked our whole life for this, you get your shit beat in

That nigga P-Double got that shit for y'alls
Peoples to rock to, stirrin' up pots of brew
In hell's kitchen, I chef the impossible
To serve hot plates all across the Unified States
Sit down and sup with the top rap reps

Those that listen get addicted to my diction
Fuck rhymes, I write prescriptions for your disease
Generic raps just not potent like P's
One-thousand one-hundred CC's on the throttle
I peel off, chest naked on Katanas
Spaghetti head Mobb niggas is full bred
Fully-blown melanin tone
I rock skeleton bone shirts and verses
But thirst for worse beats
So I can put more product out on the street
Get respect and love all across the board
We've been adored for keepin' it raw
Nothin' less or more, I score every time for sure
While the rest of y'all niggas just nil

On the first part of the journey
I was looking at all the life
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz
And the sky with no clouds
The heat was hot and the ground was dry
But the air was full of sound

[Chorus]
I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La, la ..

After two days in the desert sun
My skin began to turn red
After three days in the desert fun
I was looking at a river bed
And the story it told of a river that flowed
Made me sad to think it was dead

[Chorus]
(you see) I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain

{Bridge}

After nine days I let the horse run free
Cause the desert had turned to sea
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings
The ocean is a desert with its life underground
And a perfect disguise above
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground
But the humans will give no love

She worked her way through a cheap pack of cigarettes
Hard liquor mixed with a bit of intellect
And all the boys, they were saying they were into it
Such a pretty face, on a pretty neck

[Chorus]
She's driving me crazy, but I'm into it, but I'm into it
I'm kinda into it
It's getting crazy, I think I'm losing it, I think I'm losing it
I think she said ""I'm having your baby, it's none of your business""

[Verse 2]
It's New York, baby, always jacked up
Holland Tunnel for a nose, it's always backed up
When she's alone, she goes home to a cactus
In a black dress, she's such a such an actress

Driving me crazy, but I'm into it, but I'm into it
I'm kinda into it

She sits beside me like a silhouette
Hard candy dripping on me 'til my feet are wet
And now she's all over me, it's like I paid for it
It's like I paid for it, I'm gonna pay for this

Break MCs ligaments and the I sign the cast

Lemme ask you something
Are you content wit content
Be honest, this music has its consiquence
What you preach what you teach in our conscience
Is constant
Global, we're big in every continent
This is hip hop
A culture corrupt
We blame the industry when really tho the culprit is us
Afraid to speak up
Even the most powerful are cowards too
Dumb enough to see that its the labels we give power to
Where ya loyalty at
If I was you, I would go and give my royalties back
Im talkin
Back to community its you and me emcees against the world
As it's usually
Im just tryna reach out to these kids wit my music
And pick em up like truency
Lift em up spiritually
Give em some immunity
Im from the street, you can't teach success
You gotta earn it, won't make it as a teachers pet

It's late September and
I really should be back at school
I know I keep you amused
But I feel I'm being used

You led me away from home

Really shows your age
That don't worry me none
In my eyes you're everything
I laughed at all of your jokes

Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried anymore
You led me away from home

You stole my soul and that's a pain I can do without

All I needed was a friend
To lend a guiding hand
But you turned into a lover
And mother what a lover!
You wore me out
All you did was wreck my bed
And in the morning kick me in the head
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried anymore
You led me away from home
Cause you didn't want to be alone
You stole my heart
I couldn't leave you if I tried

I suppose I could collect my books
And get on back to school
Or steal my daddy's cue
And make a living out of playing pool
Or find myself a rock & roll band
That needs a helping hand
Oh, Maggie, I wish I'd never seen your face
You made a first-class fool out of me
But I'm as blind as a fool can be
You stole my heart but I love you anyway

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
Now that I escape, sleepwalker awake
Those who could relate know the world ain't cake
Jail bars ain't golden gates, those who fake, they break
When they meet their 400-pound mate
If I could rule the world, everyone would have a gun
In the ghetto of course, when giddyuping on their horse
I kick a rhyme drinking moonshine
I pour a sip on the concrete, for the deceased
But, no, don't weep, Wyclef's in a state of sleep
Thinking 'bout the robbery that I did last week
Money in the bag, banker looked like a drag
I want to play with pellet guns from here to Baghdad
Gun blast, think fast, I think I'm hit
My girl pinched my hips to see if I still exist
I think not, I'll send a letter to my friends
A born again hooligan only to be king again

[Verse 2: Lauryn Hill]
I play my enemies like a game of chess
Where I rest, no stress, if you don't smoke sess
Lest I must confess, my destiny's manifest
In some Goretex and sweats
I make treks like I'm homeless
Rap orgies with Porgy and Bess
Capture your bounty, like Elliot Ness, yes
Bless you if you represent the Fu
But I'll hex you with some witch's brew if you're doo-doo
Voodoo; I can do what you do, easy
Believe me, fronting niggas give me heebie-jeebies
So while you're imitating Al Capone
I'll be Nina Simone, and defecating on your microphone

From these styles I got
Oh baby, hey baby
?Cause I got a lot, oh yeah
And anywhere you go
My whole crew gonna know
Oh baby, hey baby
You can't hide from the block, oh no

[Verse 3: Pras with Lauryn Hill]
Ready or not, refugees taking over
The Buffalo Soldier, dreadlock Rasta
On the twelfth hour, fly by in my bomber
Crews run for cover, now they're under, pushing up flowers
Superfly, true lies, do or die
Toss me high, only puff lye with my crew from Lakay
I refugee from Guantanamo Bay
Dance around the border, like I'm Cassius Clay (yes, sir)

I could?ve been you
I could have gone to such great lengths

My tongue touch ya girl, ya toes bound to curl
This exclusive shit I don't share with the world
I have you up early in the mornin, moanin
Back shot, proper or low can't stop us
Been a fiend for this since Rakim made hits
Get the position down pat, then it's time to switch
I'll rock the boat, I'll work the middle
I skeet it up, straight beat it up
.. and I ain't in the hood with my toast out loc'n
I'm in the telly workin up a sweat strokin

You can call your mama right now, tell her you met a thug
I pop a lot of shit cause I can back it up

Cause my head game have you head over heels
Give a nigga the chills, have him pay my bills
Buy matchin Lambo's with the same color wheels
.. and I ain't out shopping spending dudes C-notes
I'm in the crib giving niggas deep throat
Tonight Lil' Kim gon' have you in the zone
Girls, call ya crib, I'm answering the phone
Guys wanna wife me and give me the ring
I'll do it anywhere, anyhow, I'm down for anything
Couple of humps, give a nigga goosebumps
This junk in my trunk ain't made for chumps

Come on and break down and show us who you are
Memorable first impressions only get you far
When you stay true from beginning to end
Flexing all your morals, your environment will bend back
As you bend crooked

Come on and break down fake personas from your art
I used to hang on every verse when my days would get hard
Flash forward to present day and time
A fraud, a hoax, a method actor reading scripted lines back
Why'd you take that path?
There's no way back

We are the spark that once would ignite
A pilot light burning deep in your heart
The start of making yourself out
To be bigger than you really are

Conscience is calling, come and shut it up
Yeah I know life gets rough sometimes
And big dollars take the pressure off of hard times
But gluttony's a sin and hunger will not let you win

Use some self will to control it, hold it

With unqualified pride, orders of your disguise explode
Watch us double up on those who try to intimidate unaware eyes
Fabrications of a buster living within a lie
If you come back you'll have to get (get, get, get, get)
Through all of us

[Chorus]
We are the spark that once would ignite a pilot
Light burning deep in your heart
The start of making yourself out to be bigger
Than you really are
You instilled, helped to build
A belief within me that I carry to this day
You passed the torch and cared no more
What a shame
Who's to blame when the mighty fall from grace?

And account for all your crimes

Just why?

Life switching, it's getting different
But I'm just inching to success

So far from home, I can't get your text
Did it on my own, I ain't notice threats
They nature naughty just like Treach
I'ma make it far, and it ain't a stretch
Had teachers tell me I would be less
But I never stressed, or stopped to rest
Had a lot to clean up, like a mess
Now years later, I feel greater
My show greater, kill they checks
Amble life, they gon' be vexed
They can stay hexed while I lay text like safe sex
Bishy Bish been apex, my wave next
So they can exit, I'ma wreck it 'til I perfect it
Opened up, I dissected parts of my life
Through mic sessions, now my hobby is my profession
That's the reason I'm never second
Every second's a different lesson
Ain't no way that I'm digressing 'til I'm a legend
Uh, 'til I'm a legend

Let it know, fo' inside
Rip it flow, so we shine

On the go, and we'll rewind

But I been focused while on this ride
So like the sun, sun gonna rise

I watch them all sleep, but it's fine
I ain't weak when I seen decline

They'll be on the grind 'til I flatline
Really feel like it's my time
Will he kill? Are there green limes?

Anytime I rhyme though, I body it
Got a lot to get, forget who it meant

Oh July is better off since April died
I can see September through the trees
And I can't lie, there's more to know than what's inside
Maybe there's some reason in my memories

Here come the broken hearts, just as the music starts
One by one, they testify
I never did enough, I never cared enough
Even though I stood, I always ran away

'Cause it's harder to believe that we fall sometimes
No matter how I try, I've given up

And pour it loose through your garden
So the hinges on your windows would rust and colour
Like the boats pulled up on the sand for the summer
And your sweet clean clothes would go stiff on the line
And there'd be sand in your pockets and nothing on your mind

But every year it gets a little bit harder
To get back to the feeling of when we were fifteen
And we could jump in the river upstream
And let the current carry us to the beginning where
The river met the sea again
And all our days were a sun-drenched haze
While the salt spray crusted on the window panes

We should be living like we lived that summer
I wanna live like we live in the summer
We should be living like we lived that summer
I wanna live like we live in the summer
We should be living like we lived that summer

And I'll remember that summer as the right one
The storms made the pavement steam like a kettle
And our first goodbye always seemed like hours
In the car park in between my house and yours
And if the summer holds a song we might sing forever
Then the winter holds a bite we'd never felt before

We should be living like we lived that summer
I wanna live like we live in the summer
We should be living like we lived that summer
I wanna live like we live in the summer
We should be living like we lived that summer
I wanna live like we live in the summer

But time is like the ocean
You can only hold a little in your hands
So we swim before we're broken
Before our bones become
Black coral on the sand

We should be living like we lived that summer
I wanna live like we live in the summer
We should be living like we lived that summer

I was shaking hands with the face of death
In the Amazon
I was in a trance
Tryna' catch my breath
But I couldn't run
When it came around
I was on the ground
Blood in my mouth
And I realized the whole damn time
I've been missing out

[Chorus]
Oh, we're never gonna go back to the way it was
Oh, and we're never gonna go back to the way we was
Tell me if you wanna roll with the rest of us
Cause, oh, it's never gonna go back to the way it was

[Verse 2]
Did you get your fill?
Have you seen it all?
Have you had enough?
It's a jagged pill you've been choking on
You gotta cough it up
Ain't it fine to forget your mind when you ride the wave
Summertime is only one more breath away
Just one more breath away

[Bridge]
I don't need to know what we're heading for
Babe, I'm not looking back
Listen to your feet on the wooden floor
Don't need nothing else but that
You know you don't have to take
Your past mistakes into the dawn
So drop off your bags, don't break your back
We're gonna keep moving on
We're moving on, we're moving on
We're moving on, we're moving on

I'm just a smooth operator that gets the job done
So, let me lick you from head to toe
Realllllllll slowwwwwwwww
Cause ever since I was young I could keep girls sprung
Just by the movement of my tongue
I remember it all started way back
In ummm... Kindergarten!!
Some played with Legos, some played with Play-Doh
But I was feelin' girls like a ripe tomato
And now it's 1990 and you can find me as I dunk
Lockin' up girls like I want
Yes I got a harem, but I don't share em
I collect em like per diem and MMM, you gotta see em
Because the ladies is all I dream of
And not even Anita Baker can give sweeter love
You know why?

Cause I can do it right (4X)
Yesssss I can!

[Verse 2]
Step up girls and get somethin' to treasure
And welcome to the Smooth Operator's Palace of Pleasure
And if you're wondering if I want it --
I got a Craftmatic with your name written on it
I reminisce saying I take em eight to eighty
But I was just kiddin', no you have to be a lady
Even if you're too young, with the hypest body
I just don't go to a Similac party
So all those of age, we can get intimate
Bumper to bumper, so you can get your fender bent
I treat girls just like pastry
Mmmmmmmmm *smacks lips* Tasty!
Very kinky when it comes to hanky panky
A well known player, but not for the Yankees
I won't say I'm the baddest or portray that role
But I'm of the top two, and my father's gettin' old
I'm taking love to a brand new height
And if loving girls is wrong I don't wanna be right
Cause my man Babyface said that it's no crime
And of course I'll work Diana Ross overtime
You know why?

Cause I can do it right (4X)
Yesssss I can!

[Verse 3]
If I was on the movies I'd frame Roger Rabbit
Play Spike Lee with Jessica, because she's gotta have it
But I'm not an actor, I'm just a mack
That charms girls as I whisper sweet nothings to attract her
And bring about that feeling of passion
To have her on my body like modern day fashion
Layin' next to me, in pure ecstasy
You're like a door and you know that sex the key
So send your man to the lost and found
I'm bringing something that's world renowned
In other words - good lovin' that's major
I got girls in more areas than a SkyPager
Running around saying, ""Please me, please me, please me""
That's why I say it ain't easy
But I've been able to maintain my status
With ladies macking without if's, and's, or maybe's
And other players just can't understand it
And couldn't keep they girls even if they were branded
I always end up with them on my shelf
*SMACK* I gotta jump back and kiss myself
You know why?

Cause I can do it right (4X)

Drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot
When the pigs try to get at you
Park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot
And if a nigga get a attitude
Pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot
I got the Rolly on my arm, and I'm pourin' Chandon
And I roll the best weed, ?cause I got it goin' on

[Verse 1: Pharrell]
I'm a nice dude, with some nice dreams
See these ice cubes? See these Ice Creams?
Eligible bachelor, million-dollar boat
That's whiter than what's spillin' down your throat
The Phantom, exterior like fish eggs
The interior like suicide wrist red
I can exercise you, this can be your Phys. Ed
Cheat on your man, ma, that's how you get ahizzead
Killer with the beat, I know killers in the street
With the steel that'll make you feel like Chinchilla in the heat
So don't try to run up on my ear
Talkin' all that raspy shit, tryin' to ask me shit
When my niggas fill your vest they ain't gon' pass me shit
You should think about it, take a second (Ding)
Matter fact, you should take four, b
And think before you fuck with lil Skateboard P

I'm a gangsta, but y'all knew that
Da Big Boss Dogg, yeah, I had to do that
I keep a blue flag hangin' out my backside
But only on the left side, yeah, that's the Crip side
Ain't no other way to play the game the way I play
I cut so much you thought I was a DJ
""Two, one, yep, three!""
S-N double O-P, D-O double G
I can't fake it, just break it, and when I take it
See, I specialize in makin' all the girls get naked
So bring your friends, all of y'all come inside
We got a world premiere right here, now get live!
So don't change the dizzle, turn it up a little

Drive my own cars, and wear my own clothes
I hang out tough, I'm a real boss
Big Snoop Dogg, yeah, he's so sharp
On the TV screen and in the magazines
If you play me close, you're on a red beam
Oh, you got a gun, so you wanna pop back?
AK-47 now, nigga, stop that!
Cement shoes, now I'm on the move
Your family's cryin', now you on the news
They can't find you, and now they miss you
Must I remind you, I'm only here to twist you
Pistol-whip you, dip you, then flip you
Then dance to this mothafuckin' music we Crip to
Subscribe, nigga, get your issue
Baby, come close, let me see how you get loose!

Full moon under dark skies
Tears fall behind phone screens
Lonely hearts lead to bad dreams
Wish that I could be there for you
I hope that life will be fair for you
It's hard to sleep cause I'm always thinking
And passing out off of codeine
And I hope you know that I'm not complaining
Hope you know I appreciate it

Man every day is just thanks and praises
But memories of your birthday, they get me in the worst ways

Losing my focus, symphonies open
Singing my opus, just think for a moment

Invite other people that helped us get started to
To all of you artists that feel a martyr
Don't ever give up, you just gotta go harder

Yeah I know he's been a good friend of mine

And she's lovin' him with that body

Of people way out the door

And I got that music for your ears
And it?s like knock, knock, knock goes the diesel
If you really wanna see the beautiful people

Waking up in my college dorm
Yeah, my life, it was pretty normal
Looking for a date to the spring formal
Wasn't worried 'bout nothing else, no
Majoring in Undecided
Notebook full of bad songs I was writing
Never dreamed anybody else would like them
Now they're sitting on a Walmart shelf

[Chorus]
Ain't it funny how life changes
You wake up, ain't nothing the same and life changes
You can't stop it, just hop on the train, and
You never know what's gonna happen
You make your plans and you hear God laughing
Life changes, and I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no
And I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no

[Verse 2]
I bought a ring and she said, ""I do""
But everybody else said, ""Man, you're twenty-two
Whatcha trying to prove? Hey, why don't you wait?""
'Cause I've been waiting on her since the second grade, yeah
And now she got her own set of fans
She got a blue check mark by her Instagram
And I wrote a little song about holding her hand
And now everybody wanna die happy, man

[Chorus]
Ain't it funny how life changes
You wake up ain't nothing the same and life changes
You can't stop it just hop on the train, and
You never know what's gonna happen

And I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no

I remember the day I told my Daddy and Mama
""You're gonna have a grandkid, yep
From Uganda, that's right, we're adopting
And she is the cutest little girl that you've ever seen""
Well I was wrapping my head around being a dad
A big wrench got thrown in the plans we thought we had
Now Lauren's showing, got one on the way
Yeah that's two into two, hey, what can I say?

Parading in a wake of sad relations as their shoes fill up with water

But tonight you're on my mind so you never know

Broken down and hungry for your love with no way to feed it
Where are you tonight, child you know how much I need it
Too young to hold on and too old to just break free and run

Sometimes a man gets carried away, when he feels like he should be having his fun
And much too blind to see the damage he's done
Sometimes a man must awake to find that really, he has no-one

It's never over, all my riches for her smiles when I slept so soft against her
It's never over, all my blood for the sweetness of her laughter

You living the life in the ghetto paradise
You living that life in the ghetto paradise

[Verse 1]
Mi nuh know how mi survive the hardship weh in ya
Life never sweet like ah chocolate vanilla
Train line mi born mi nuh born inna villa
Likkle monkey watch how you ah talk to Gorilla
Cah, the government buy arms give the killer
Two party ah flex like a party dem inna
Accepting presents from foreign government
Weh still ah fool dem and a school dem and a khaki dem in
Good god of Moses and Rodney the Killer
Poor people fed up and we can't sim simmer
Can hardly survive as a blasted singer
Much less a baller who is a rahtid winger
Have a right foot like a David Villa
Him mother still ah sell inna market
Jamrock is a precious stone still it's far from a diamond, take it from I man

[Chorus]
Even though Jamaica nice
You gotta live to save your life
After the sunset comes the darkness of the night
Better open up your eyes
You've gotta read between the lines
Living in the ghetto paradise

[Verse 2]
Jamaica spiritually irie
Pretty and it nice
Still a ghetto paradise and mi nah apologise
It Slippery and it slidey
Di government ah lie
Dem trick we and dem buy we
Di chicken and di fries
Spend a little of your time
You giggle and you smile
But even if you try
You couldn't live some ah we life
Riverton ah bun, di likkle pickney dem a cry
Di chubby bottle dem ah pile up on the river side
And den you talk how Jamaica sweet
Wah sweet you will rotten your teeth
And in the streets it nuh nice and easy
Shot a beat, ghetto youths can't sleep
And then you talk how Jamaica nice
You say you living in a paradise
Poverty whistle like a Christmas breeze, yeah
You better take my foolish advice

[Chorus]
Even though Jamaica nice
You gotta live to save your life
After the sunset comes the darkness of the night
You better open up your eyes
And read between the lines
When you're living in the ghetto paradise

[Bridge]
Survival
Only the fittest
Shall make it out of this jungle alive
Survival
Jah is my witness
The darkest hours of the night is just before daylight

A decade ago
I never thought I would be
At twenty-three
On the verge of spontaneous combustion
Woe is me

But I guess that it comes with the territory
An ominous landscape of never ending calamity
I need you to hear
I need you to see that I have had all that I can take
And exploding seems like a definite possibility to me

So pardon me while I burst into flames
I've had enough of the world and its people's mindless games
So pardon me while I burn and rise above the flame
Pardon me, pardon me, I'll never be the same

[Verse 2]
Now two days ago
I was having a look in a book
And I saw a picture of a guy fried up above his knee
I said, ""I can relate!""
Because lately I've been thinking of combustication
As a welcomed vacation
From the burdens of the planet earth
Like gravity, hypocrisy, and the perils of being in 3D
But thinking so much differently

[Chorus]
So pardon me while I burst into flames
I've had enough of the world and its people's mindless games
So pardon me while I burn and rise above the flame

That David played and it pleased the Lord

The baffled king composing Hallelujah

You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you

Prowl for the best chick, yes, I'm on the lookout (Let's dance)
Slow banging shorty like a belly dancer with it
Smell good, pretty skin, so gangsta with it (Ooh, baby)
No tricks, only diamonds under my sleeve
Gimme the number but make sure you call before you leave

[Verse 2: The Pussycat Dolls + (CeeLo)]
I know you like me (I know you like me)
I know you do (I know you do)
That's why whenever I come around, she's all over you
And I know you want it (I know you want it)
It's easy to see (It's easy to see)
And in the back of your mind
I know you should be fuckin' with me

[Hook: The Pussycat Dolls]
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me?
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was a freak like me?
Don't cha, don't cha?
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was raw like me?
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was fun like me?
Don't cha, don't cha?

[Verse 3: The Pussycat Dolls + (CeeLo)]
Fight the feeling (fight the feeling)
Leave it alone (leave it alone)
'Cause if it ain't love
It just ain't enough to leave a happy home (uh-uh, uh-uh)
Let's keep it friendly (let's keep it friendly)
You have to play fair (you have to play fair, yeahh)
See, I don't care
But I know, she ain't gon' wanna share

[Hook: The Pussycat Dolls & Busta Rhymes]
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was a freak like me (like me)
Don't cha, don't cha, baby
Don't cha, alright, sing
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was raw like me (raw)
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was fun like me (big thrills)
Don't cha, (OK I see how it's goin down) ahhh, don't cha
(Seems like shorty wanna little menage pop off or sumthin, let's go)

[Verse 4: Busta Rhymes]
Well, let me get straight to it
Every broad wanna watch a nigga when I come through it
It's the god almighty, lookin' all brand new
If shorty wanna jump in my Aston Vanquish
Lookin' at me all like she really wanna do it
Tryna put it on me 'til my balls black and blueish
You wanna play with a player, girl, then play on
Strip out the Chanel and leave the lingerie on
Watch me and I'mma watch you at the same time
Lookin' at you wanna break my back
You the very reason why I keep a pack of the Magnum
And with the wagon, hit you in the back of the Magnum
For the record, don't think it was something you did
Shorty all on me 'cause it's hard to resist the kid
I got a idea that's dope for y'all
As y'all could get [?] so I could hit the both of y'all

[Verse 5: The Pussycat Dolls + (CeeLo)]
I know she loves you (I know she loves you)
I understand (I understand)
I probably be just as crazy about you
If you were my own man
Maybe next lifetime (maybe next lifetime)
Possibly (possibly)
Until then, old friend, your secret is safe with me

[Intro: Ricky Martin]
Fiebre, pierdo el sentido
Me va bajando despacito por el cuello hasta el ombligo
Y sabes, no tiene cura
Y voy perdiendo los modales, educacin y compostura

Fiebre, que no descansa
Y va bajando lentamente resbalando por mi espalda
Y sube, a cuarenta grados
Me recorre todo el cuerpo cuando pasas a mi lado

Dime cmo hacer pa' quitar mis penas ('W', Yandel)
Que mi corazn no aguanta tanta presin, porque...

Pensando en ti y en tus ojos negros, y en tu risa bella
Yo me la paso cada da pensando en ti (ay, ay, ay, ay)
Y que entre tus brazos pierdo la cabeza

There's a thing that happens when two people decide

Alright stop, collaborate and listen
Ice is back with my brand new invention
Something grabs a hold of me tightly
Flow like a harpoon daily and nightly
Will it ever stop yo I don't know
Turn off the lights and I'll glow
To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle
Dance go rush to the speaker that booms
I'm killing your brain like a poisonous mushroom
Deadly when I play a dope melody
Anything less than the best is a felony
Love it or leave it you better gangway
You better hit bull's eye the kid don't play

[Verse 2]
Now that the party is jumping
With the bass kicked in and the Vegas are pumping
Quick to the point to the point no faking
I'm cooking MCs like a pound of bacon
Burning them if you ain't quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi-hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll and it's time to go solo
Rollin' in my 5.0
With my rag-top down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby waving just to say hi
""Did you stop?"" No, I just drove by
Kept on pursuing to the next stop
I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block
The block was dead
Yo so I continued to A1A Beachfront Avenue
Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis
Rockman lovers driving Lamborghinis
Jealous cause I'm out getting mine
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine
Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps acting ill because they're full of eight ball
Gunshots rang out like a bell
I grabbed my nine all I heard were shells
Falling on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed
I'm trying to get away before the jackers jack
Police on the scene you know what I mean
They passed me up confronted all the dope fiends
If there was a problem yo I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

[Hook]
Ice ice baby
Ice ice baby

[Verse 3]
Take heed cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it
My town that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
Cause my style's like a chemical spill
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed, this is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step
With this.  Shay plays on the fade
Slice like a ninja, cut like a razor blade
So fast, other DJs say ""Damn!""
If my rhyme was a drug I'd sell it by the gram
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice
If there was a problem yo I'll solve it
Check out the hook while D-Shay revolves it

It's empty in the valley of your heart
The sun, it rises slowly as you walk
Away from all the fears

You cannibal, you meat-eater, you see

I know the shame in your defeat

And see the world hanging upside down
You can understand dependence
When you know the maker's hand

So make your siren's call
And sing all you want
I will not hear what you have to say

And I need to know how
To live my life as it's meant to be

And all I do is think of you
Yo I remember when we met the whole scene was set
Backstage rockin' black shades
Told you not to be afraid
We touched, then your smile turned to a blush
I had to get to know your name
Then I got your number
Seventeen and under, maybe just a little younger
Had to get to know cause there's things I got to show you
Forget them other brothers they know lines that they told you
Now your acting all shy, hmm I wonder why
Everytime I look at you, you turn and drop your eye
We faced, began to lace you up with lines
Fragrance by Ann Klein had me loosing my mind
With your zodiac sign, my perfect match in fact
I'm compatible with anything from Mio to Ash
Now it's all about uus cause we're hooked like drug
I'm on my way to being a thug, show me love

Boy all I see is you and me
And all I do is think of you
Give me the chance to know your name
I'll never turn and walk away
I can't get you out of my mind
I'd be lying
If I said I wasn't hooked after just one look
Yeah see you at the mall with your mom looking all flashy
Poppin' out of a taxi, met eyes when you passed me
Been inside of my head all day
What can I say?
All I can do is reminisce like Mary J
I want to get with you
So come and get with me
We'll be K-I-S-S-I-N-G
And all that good stuff
Calling you bluff, now look at us

Just met and already talkin' 'bout trust
All the things we did
How we planned to live
How you got rid of that kid, who use to call you crib
Shut it down
Now look what you found state of dawn
You da bomb, plus you got props from my mom
Now it's all about uus cause we're hooked like drugs
I'm on my way to being a thug, show me love

I can't get you out of my mind
Think about you all of the time
Got to get to know you babe, baby, oh
I'm glad I made my move
I'm glad I stepped to you
Enough respect that my whole crew excepted you
Even my ex called you
She wasn't insecure
Feeling she got a little hurt but was being mature
Gave her blessing
She learned a valuable lesson
Now she's my best friend
Don't even stress, Cause all I see is you and me
Like Latifah you're queen lets bring some unity
Ain't no reason to fight, We're always keeping it tight
Whether walking or holding hands or sharing seats on the bike
Always on my mind with your Gucci design
Feel free to drop a line, yeah that would suit me fine
It's all about you boo, and all the things you do
Making dreams come true, buying rings for two
Now it's all about uus cause we're hooked like drugs

Bad medicine is what I need
Shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can
Cure my disease

[Verse 1]
I ain't got a fever got a permanent disease
It'll take more than a doctor to prescribe a remedy
I got lots of money but it isn't what I need
Gonna take more than a shot to get this poison out of me
I got all the symptoms count them 1,2,3
First you need
That's what you get for falling in love
Then you bleed
You get a little but it's never enough
On your knees
That's what you get for falling in love
And now this boy's addicted cause your kiss is the drug

I don't need no needle
To be giving me a thrill
And I don't need no anesthesia
Or a nurse to bring a pill
I got a dirty down addiction
It doesn't leave a track
I got a jolt for your affection
Like a monkey on my back
There ain't no paramedic
Going to save this heart attack

You get a little but it's never enough

You're an all night generator wrapped is stockings and a dress
When you find your medicine you take what you can get
Cause if there's something better baby well they haven't found it yet

In this mother
Straight from Houston, Tex
The motherfuckin' Dr. Dooom
I'm shuttin' rappers down like guiliani shut down strip clubs
Turnin' your fake gangster hardcore stories
Into some Mickey Mouse, Teletubbies shit
Y'all niggas need to quit, stop pullin' your silicone tits
And this city is my town
Don't even fuckin' tryin' to say a fly rhyme
I'm holdin' possessions you don't own
And your cellular phone don't even fuckin' roam
Y'all got the nerve to be standin' in the hot rap zone
Against somethin' you can't afford
Rappers be soundin' bored at the show
I need to start pullin' your bitch-ass fuckin' extension cord
Suckers be fakers, ATM pullin' frauds
I'm sendin' two men, out to boo men
Quick to get to y'all niggas like Western Union
I'm comin' like the fax machine
I pour it on your whole team
Y'all niggas ain't got time to scheme
I'm out to shatter your fuckin' rap dreams
Top to bottom, any angle, whatever your bullshit mind think
Your words gon' tangle
Sound like shit on a tascan mix
Professionally, you sound like the dog toto
When I see Flex, I'ma ask him
Why he playin' a lot of records from a bunch of homos
With feminine vocals
I catch niggas when clubs are packed, rubbin' elbows
Tryin' to whisper shit in ugly bitches earlobes
Dr. Dooom callin' wack niggas houses from the Radisson hotel room
Penthouse suites, bitch niggas get 911 beeps
I'm always hearin' more softest MC's talk shit about the streets
Fuck your seedy impression of pain
Ninety-nine percent of your shit was normal
One percent sound strange
A&R's be suckin' a lot of dick
And spreadin' they ass cheeks to get the hits
Dr. Dooom is in the room
Walkin' up the street, with bare feet, eatin' raw steak meat
Dr. Dooom is in the room
Walkin' up the street, with bare feet, eatin' raw steak meat
Dr. Dooom is in the room
Walkin' up the street, with bare feet, eatin' raw steak meat
Dr. Dooom is in the room
Walkin up
You couldn't rap with me if we was twins stuck together
You be the deformed one, catchin' the warm one
I pay a crack head five dollars
To fuck up your million dollar marketing plan
With a brand new sub-machine gun
And a hot dog, on a Yankee stadium bun
First class rates, hire wall street messengers
To move your antique rap styles in milk crates
Special delivery for all you motherfuckers
Sportin' hard boots with ashey faces tryin' to get with me
Y'all suckers is amateurs, gettin' fucked up the assholes
By the top worst managers
On the publishin' deal, wipe my condoms off your Ampex reels
No games to be played, you lookin' fuckin' jiggy
MC's with collared shirts and shoes tryin' to duplicate biggie
No matter where, you only got one pair
Alligators don't match with them fuckin' flares
Who's doin' your dress code, some old stank bitch
With mascara touchin' up your face on the road
You feelin' healthier, your rap audience
Is only New Pork to Philadelphia
Baltimore never even heard your fuckin' metaphor
Shut the fuck up, put your buck up, look at the dicks you suck up
Maximum ass thoughts, you fuckin' get crushed
Like the five o'clock train rush, sweaty as a motherfucker
The best rapper can lick my ass
I make your girl pick me up lick my sperm in your E-class
Leave my diapers moist in the back seat of your rolls Royce
Stop your whole organization on park avenue and start laughin' at you
Dr. Dooom is in the room
Walkin' up the street, with bare feet, eatin' raw steak meat
Dr. Dooom is in the room
Walkin' up the street, with bare feet, eatin' raw steak meat
Dr. Dooom is in the room
Walkin' up the street, with bare feet, eatin' raw steak meat
Dr. Dooom is in the room
Walkin' up the street, with bare feet, eatin' raw steak meat
You ain't the top rap in the country
New jacks, you shoulda knew that
From experience, you couldn't write from the beginnin'
Bookin' studio time, with some scramblin' concert shit on your mind
Who's crowd, the blues feel my news
Accurately in New York City
There's a thousand motherfuckers tryin' to rap and look pretty
Save it for David
Take that motherfuckin' rented ride back to Avis
When it come to rap I'm the big motherfucker on the pay list
Ridin' the Amtrak, lookin' at Billboard
You need to be hung on a steel cord
Sittin' next to a Doberman, shit in Harlem
Any poodles on the mic, we gon' stop 'em
I'm in the dressin' room with the average bitch
Lookin' like halle berry, rubbin' my nuts
My fingers all up in her guts
Watchin' Monday night football with my dick all up in her butt
MC's stand away when I pull out my mitt put your hand away
Most of these fake hard rappers never seen the projects
Live in fuckin' pesquateway
Scared, palm that away
Why don't you bastards move back in the metro area
The Marriott is the spot
Where the prostitutes lick your Rolex watch
Left you naked out with your stomach out
Hangin' out with cocaine on the dresser
With a Puerto Rican girl with HIV from park chester

Yeah, it's Dolph
Hey, bring me some Backwoods up outta there, homie and a cup of ice
And some rubber bands up outta there too, homie, yeah
It's 3 PM, 80 degrees outside
I'm in somethin' that go real fast, sittin' outside the cornerstore
Six figure client, got no business in this area

[Verse 1]
If it ain't one thing, it's a motherfuckin' 'nother (goddamn)
We trapped together than that's my motherfuckin' brother (that's my dog)
I pay her bills and buy her designer but I don't love her (hey, what you need, lil' mama?)
She just play her part when it's time to smuggle (ayy, you ready?)
I pull up, pick up that bag, and burn rubber (skrrt)
I got a sweet tooth but I stay away from suckers (for real though)
Nobu in Malibu was my last supper (we eatin' good)
I fucked her in rush hour traffic, Chris Tucker (haha, yeah)
Everybody screamin' gang gang gang (gang)
Them folks come and get you, you gon' tell on the whole gang (gang)
She said can she fuck me with my diamond chains?
If I ain't in the bank, then I'm on the plane (yeah, hey)
'Bout to go get some money or go spend some money (yeah)
They stopped me in the airport, had too many benjis on me (Franklins)
They don't want you to live, they don't want you to ball
Them pussies smile in your face, yeah, then they pray for you to fall, hey
Young nigga stay focused (yeah)
But I really want to crash (damn)
Think about where you at (okay)
Then think about your past (alright)
Yeah, I really came from shit (yeah)
But I won't change for shit (nah)

My wrist say I been getting paid (yeah)

A hundred shots, a hundred shots
Me and my niggas pull up in a hundred drops (skrrt)
My role model used to get a hundred blocks (hey)
Street niggas in a tuxedo, we the mob (yeah)

[Verse 2]
She looked at my watch too long, now she see stars (blow, blow)
I got so high last night I did a show on Mars (woo)
Your bitch ate my dick, I caught her on them bars (Xanax)
My pinky ring extra large (yeah)
Foreigns all in the garage
Remember my first menage (yeah)
Yeah, Tori and Brittany (yup)
I'm shoppin' for diamonds at Tiffany's (Tiffany's)
No, I don't got no sympathy (nah)
She blew my whistle like a referee (wet)
Broke black nigga, remember me? (Hey)
Until I found out that recipe (yeah, woo)
Started getting about ten a week (yeah)
Finger on the trigger when I sleep (yup)
Yeah, nigga, I rather you than me (yeah)
Backseat, smokin' good weed (gelato)

[Chorus]
A hundred shots, a hundred shots
How the fuck you miss a whole hundred shots?

[Verse 3]
You not welcome at my trap if you don't shop (ayy, get out, bro)
Before you come through that back door you better knock (ayy, get the door)
They been waitin' on this gangster shit to drop (bulletproof)
Even them fuck niggas that wish I could be stopped (hey, hey)
How many dicks you sucked to get that couple million? (Hahaha)
Self made millionaire, oh what a feelin' (yeah, yeah)
My niggas came from dealin' (ayy)
Fuck nigga get out your feelings (ayy)
Your bitch gave me sexual healin' (woo)
Guess who just walked in the buildin'? (It's Dolph)
Came out with six bitches (wet)
My uncle said that's pimpin'
My diamonds always hittin' (uh)
You lookin' for your bitch, she with me nigga, she ain't missin' (nah)
I told you fuck nigga stay out my way, but you didn't listen (stupid ass niggas, yeah)
Big rocks, in my watch (hey, hey, in my watch)
And we put extensions in all of the Glocks (haha)

Make you say a nigga blew up too fast
Fuck I'm 'sposed to do with all this new ass?
Fuck I'm 'sposed to do with all this new cash?
Thousand dollar drawers just to hold my balls
All I ever do is let my jewels sag
Pac gone, but the ""Juice"" back
Get your popcorn, juice, snacks
It's a movie nigga, with a new cast
Get the news flash, that the truth back
This is boom bap, mixed with new raps
Look at all the niggas that I blew past
Hood by Air, to the do-rag
Nigga make way for the new jacks

[Verse 2]
It's Mr. Pistol Popper screaming, ""Fuck a copper""
I just bought a crispy choppa, finna fuck your block up, blocka!
Even cracked the pavement that's for niggas hating
I been impatiently waiting to show you niggas Satan
All this talk of Illuminati ain't got a clue about me
Bitch I'm Trillmaluminati and got my crew behind me
Shooters round me, keep them looters round me
Keep a tool around me, it'll keep you fools from round me
Couple of them dudes surround me
With a gat, with a strap in a backpack
When they cap cap, leave you flat, better back back
On a fast track, ratatat, nigga that's that
Nigga pass that, finna ash, where the hash at
Got a Kat Stacks with a ass, finna smash that
Make 'em catch that, A$AP, then I pass that
Off to my niggas then she ask, ""Where the cash at?""

I caught a trucker out of Philly had a nice long toke

Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me, it isn't over

Nevermind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

You'd know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me, it isn't over

Nevermind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?

Nevermind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Don't forget me, I beg, I remembered you said:-
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

Ja nie zaczn? od hashtaga z Mobb Deep, odbij, mam bastion z liter
Bo przetrwaj? mocni, chuj ?e masz kaloryfer
(Co?) Pierdol kurtuazj?, szykuj si? na walk?
Mym punchom z bitem uk?oni?by si? Walter
Przetrwaj? najtwardsze sztuki st?d
S?dzisz, ?e immunitet mo?na kupi?? B??d
Wbijam im si? w ?eb jednym s?owem
I rosn? tam jak p?d, bo z podziwu zachodz? w g?ow?

[Zwrotka 2: Numer Raz]
Znw rosn? w si??, a si?a to pot?ga
Jak ?y?em, tak ?y?em, teraz czas zwyci??a?
By?em i b?d?, to wiedz ja
Nie mam zamiaru tak ?atwo odpuszcza?, to mnie nap?dza
To bit Prima, wci?? trzyma poziom i nie kimam, jak Alpina
Daj? dobry d?wi?k i klimat
Mam to w genach i szczena ci opadnie
Bo przetrwa silniejszy, a s?abszy odpadnie

[Zwrotka 3: Proceente]
Szczebel po szczeblu, ca?e ?ycie w biegu
Lepiej wiedzie?, kim jest DJ Premier, gdzie jest epicentrum
Wchodzisz w entertainment i nie zdajesz sobie sprawy
?e twj wnuk oceni twj dorobek za cztery dekady
Jak masz si?? i nie jeste? g?upi to sobie poradzisz
A jak jeste? s?aby to wyginiesz jak mamuty
Od pocz?tku z najlepszego kruszcu, pompuj musku?
I nie tra? w?tku, nie tra? pulsu

[Cuty: The Returners, DJ Flip]
Przetrwa? po trupach, spytaj tych co polegli
To normalne, w tej grze, wygrywa najsilniejszy
Najsilniejsi wytrwaj?, najwa?niejsza rzecz to przetrwanie
Co by si? nie dzia?o tak pozostanie

[Zwrotka 4: Pelson]
Strza?, b?yszcz? flesze, jeste? na ulicy
Paparazzi? Nie, to policyjni technicy
Jeden we?mie kred?, odrysuje twj kontur
Sprawca p?niej zezna, ?e zrobi? to dla sportu
Zreszt? win? ?atwo mu udowodni?
Gdy ka?dy dobry wers to odcisk na miejscu zbrodni
Mia? by? czerwony dywan jest czerwony chodnik
Bo nie przetrwaj? najsilniejsi tylko wiarygodni

[Zwrotka 5: Rahim]
S?abo?? puka, stuka, z buta, bij? na alarm
Chyba szukam, nie tutaj, muka, niech spierdala
Ci?nie w swym despotyzmie skra?? mi rogala
Ziom, trzymam si? z dala, spadam st?d, yalla yalla!
Wbijam w s?abostki, wbijam troski na marazm
A s?abej jednostki los nabijam na pala
Ogie? rozpalam w tobie bez tutoriala
Pi?kny widok, samsara, wchodzi rap przy fanfarach

[Zwrotka 6: ?ysol]
Je?li koniec jest blisko to czeka go k?opot, bo
Przetrwa? mog? wszystko, p?-cz?owiek, p?-mikrofon
Chuj z apokalips? jak i ca?ym afterem
Jak w Apocalypto Gibson, sam jestem re?yserem
Bo hip-hop to przysz?o?? i tworz? historie
Robi? to lepiej, ty gorzej, s? dwie kategorie
Kiedy to wszystko pierdolnie pozostan? tu na zawsze
Bo twardsze przetrwaj?, a wygin? te s?absze

[Cuty: The Returners, DJ Flip]

[Zwrotka 7: Gruby Mielzky]
Nie jestem obcy, grze jak Philly Vinnie Paz
Mielz tyle skilli, ?e widzi sam Stevie je
Blam bidi beng wisi mi na szyi kiet z linii met
Inni s? veni, vidi ja mam vici, winisz mnie?
Wyros?em po?rd hien, przetrwa?em ka?d? z walk
Gra?em na setce scen, daj?c wam ci??ki bas
Wiedz? na mie?cie czyje s?owo ponad
Pokonam reszt?, k?ad?c litery na stronach

[Zwrotka 8: Astek/Pierwszy S?aw]
Jak ci? widz? tak ci? pisz? i to wcale niefajne
Ka?de lustro w domu mam podpisane punchlinem
Twarda bania, no bo twarde Ba?uty
Tu zawsze idziem za ciosem jak jebane mamuty
Na g??bokich wodach ?ycia ka?dy wymi?knie
Ty uwa?aj na z?by, wyp?ywamy; al dente
Twardzi przetrwaj?, zdechn? ci s?absi
Zera spierdala?; denominacja

[Zwrotka 9: Zeus]
W tym jestem specem jak Nas - rap Specnaz
Gdy sk?adam punch instynktownie drzesz si? ""nie w twarz!""
Chcesz zabra? g?os? S?ycha? Twoje ""eeee...."" i ""hush!!""
Twj g?os dzi? ko?czy w urnie - spopielony sorry, baby... b-ash!
Mj wielki prezydencki marsz wspar? premier
Gdy wdra?am plan, ka?dy gor?cy kot ko?czy na drzewie
Dzisiejszy rap to link do bazy ?liskich larw...
Jestem na kolizyjnym kursie z Wami #linkinpark

[Cuty: The Returners, DJ Flip]
Przetrwa? po trupach, spytaj tych co polegli
To normalne, w tej grze, wygrywa najsilniejszy
Najsilniejsi wytrwaj?, najwa?niejsza rzecz to przetrwanie
Co by si? nie dzia?o tak pozostanie

[Zwrotka 10: Chada]
Najsilniejsi przetrwaj?, nie mw ?e bzdury pieprz?
Bo nie chodzi mi tu wcale o obwd w bicepsie
Moi bracia to wiedz?, zaczyna?em od zera
Musisz walczy?, ja wci?? si? b?d? przy tym upiera?
Jaka kapitulacja, nie ko?czymy na ch?ciach
Dla adeptw tych blokw to jest nie do przyj?cia
Wci?? zach?cam b?d? silny, wtedy na pewno przetrwasz
Proste credo dla wszystkich ludzi z miejskiego getta

[Zwrotka 11: Klasik]
Cho? nie jestem z Shaolinu mam filozofi? swoj? jak RZA
?aden ze mnie produkt, nie stworzy? mnie Blizzard
Ja chce s?ysze? d?wi?k samplerw, czu? zapach p?yt
Na ?cianach b?ysk lakierw, nie znasz tego - nie znasz nic
Kiedy? patrzy?em z pod-ziemia, teraz patrz? spod-nieba
Jestem nie do sprzedania, nie do kupienia
Wi?cej mi nic nie trzeba, przetrwam tu ka?dy dzie?
Pki mam cel, pty mog? spe?nia? swj sen

[Zwrotka 12: Quebonafide]
Po pierwsze primo, to jest mj rok, mam dj? vu
Na te pok?ady braggi nawet Mistrz Miyagi rady nie da?by
Mam funky styl, swaggy fit, funky styl, swaggy fit
Po drugie: Preemo, dawaj bit, jestem MC, jakie ci?cie
Jak jeszcze nie kumasz ka?dy mj werset rodzi si? w blach
Mam product placement Redbulla, wacki gula, ?e tak to hula
A jak si? sprawa ma, ?e tak to buja, ?e buja tym karkiem przy tym nawet Jabba Hutt

[Cuty: The Returners, DJ Flip]

[Zwrotka 13: JodSen]
Czu?em to w swoich snach, ich strach pachnie jak Paco Rabanne
Kiedy gram, albo ?api? ""Stan"" tak jak psychofan w klipie Ema
Ema! nie wiesz co robi??
Nawijam tak ?e twoje ?ywe legendy przewracaj? si? w grobie
Teraz. Czego tu brak? Kto tu ma, a kto nie ma flow?
Nagroda Darwina, haaa, ktry? wack dostanie j?
Ty od postw kifoza, si? prostuj i zobacz
Joda nie pali mostw by mieli pod czym l?dowa?

[Zwrotka 14: Joteste]
Walcz? o przetrwanie w grze, pierdolony Cast Away
Jestem m?ody, utalentowany, mw mi Tommy Hanks
Mnie zdobi d?wi?k, flow to as w r?kawie
To jest Masta Ace, moj? kart? na bit k?ad?
Jak Gerry Lane mam w sobie ten instynkt
Chc? przetrwa? kiedy reszta dostaje w?cieklizny
Wiem, to nie science-fiction, niespokojny ?wiat
Bo to nie s? Gwiezdne Wojny, to s? wojny gwiazd

[Zwrotka 15: Rado Radosny/Drugi S?aw]
Wszystko prze?yj? - takie chuchro na pozr
Jestem Rado, mwi? s?abo, kiedy mwi? ""sta? z boku""
Nie obchodz? mnie rankingi, bo nie ma tam S?aww
A powrotem roku dla mnie jest Beata z Klanu
[a-a] Rapowe ziarno zamieni? na talent
Siej? rozpierdol, poczuj stwardnienie rozsiane
Twardy jak skurwysyn, nie p?aka?em po Papale
[znacz?ca przerwa] #makao po makale

[Cuty: The Returners, DJ Flip]
Przetrwa? po trupach, spytaj tych co polegli
To normalne, w tej grze, wygrywa najsilniejszy
Najsilniejsi wytrwaj?, najwa?niejsza rzecz to przetrwanie
Co by si? nie dzia?o tak pozostanie

[Zwrotka 16: Bezczel]
Po pierwsze primo silniejsze s? tu sk?din?d; blow
Po drugie primo te s?abe wygin?; dinozaur
Temu od dzisiaj nie pytaj si? gdzie jest Eis
Tu bo dzisiaj to  Micha? upycha na bitach to flow jak Ace
Szed?em ma?ym krokami tu ca?ymi latami
A ci s?abi chc? zabi? mnie tu za to, wini? i gani?
Ich scena to st? z powy?amywanymi nogami
O kulach nigdy nie pjd? tu w jednej linii z nami

[Zwrotka 17: Siwers]
To chirurgiczne uderzenie jak wjazd Delta Force
Eliminuje cele, mic - snajperka, wzrok
Skanuje, ten fach w r?ku, a w r?kach bro?
Przetrwam jak moje wersy wylane na wosk
Jem tylko steki z osobnikw alfa
Na bitach jak rekin, ty znowu robisz karpia
Jak szcz?ki na p?tli zaciska si? punchline
Nawija? Siwers aka Ludojad, ?ar?acz

[Zwrotka 18: Ten Typ Mes]
O smej wy??czy?em TVN, poczu?em si? s?abiej
Breee! Znowu zwrci?em na siebie uwag?
Potem siad?em do tekstu, bit DJ Premier
Jak dla mnie mo?e by? nawet DJ Wjt, nie jestem bity w ciemi?
Agrrr! Jestem ill nawet wspak
Wi?c zmieniam imi? na ""lli"" kiedy cisn? chory rap
S?yszysz lee, pisane jak te jeansy
Wi?c kiedy pies spyta o dane, odpowiem ""lli-sz-mi-td""

[Verse 1]
I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address
In a torn up town, no post code envy

[Pre-Chorus]
But every song's like gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care; we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care; we aren't caught up in your love affair

[Chorus]
And we'll never be royals (royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (ruler), you can call me Queen Bee
And baby I'll rule (I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule...)
Let me live that fantasy

[Verse 2]
My friends and I we've cracked the code
We count our dollars on the train to the party
And everyone who knows us knows
That we're fine with this, we didn't come from money

C'mon, man

[Interlude]
And with the local DBT news, LL Cool J with a triumphant comeback
But tonight

[Verse 1]
Don't call it a comeback, I been here for years
Rocking my peers and putting suckas in fear
Making the tears rain down like a monsoon
Listen to the bass go boom
Explosion, overpowering
Over the competition, I'm towering
Wrecking shop, when I drop
These lyrics that'll make you call the cops
Don't you dare stare, you better move
Don't ever compare
Me to the rest that'll all get sliced and diced
Competition's paying the price

[Hook:]
I'm gonna knock you out HUUUH!!!
Mama said knock you out HUUUH!!!
I'm gonna knock you out HUUUH!!!
Mama said knock you out HUUUH!!!
I'm gonna knock you out HUUUH!!!
Mama said knock you out HUUUH!!!
I'm gonna knock you out HUUUH!!!
Mama said knock you out HUUUH!!!

[Verse 2]
Don't you call this a regular jam
I'm gonna rock this land
I'm gonna take this itty bitty world by storm
And I'm just getting warm
Just like Muhummad Ali they called him Cassius
Watch me bash this beat like a skull
Cause you know I had beef wit
Why do you riff with me, the maniac psycho
And when I pull out my jammy get ready cause it might go
BLAAAAW, how ya like me now?
The ripper will not allow
You to get with, Mr. Smith, don't riff
Listen to my gear shift
I'm blasting, outlasting
Kinda like Shaft, so you could say I'm shafting
Olde English filled my mind
And I came up with a funky rhyme

[Hook]
I'm gonna knock you out HUUUH!!!
Mama said knock you out HUUUH!!!
I'm gonna knock you out HUUUH!!!
Mama said knock you out HUUUH!!!
I'm gonna knock you out HUUUH!!!
Mama said knock you out HUUUH!!!
I'm gonna knock you out HUUUH!!!
Mama said knock you out HUUUH!!!
Breakdown!!!

Shadow boxing when I heard you on the radio HUUUH!!!
I just don't know
What made you forget that I was raw?
But now I got a new tour
I'm going insane, starting the hurricane, releasing pain
Letting you know that you can't gain, I maintain
Unless ya say my name
Ripping, killing
Digging and drilling a hole
Pass the Ol' Gold

[Hook]
I'm gonna knock you out HUUUH!!!
Mama said knock you out HUUUH!!!
I'm gonna knock you out HUUUH!!!
Mama said knock you out HUUUH!!!
I'm gonna knock you out HUUUH!!!
Mama said knock you out HUUUH!!!
I'm gonna knock you out HUUUH!!!
Mama said knock you out HUUUH!!!

Shotgun blasts are heard
When I rip and kill, at will
The man of the hour, tower of power, I'll devour
I'm gonna tie you up and let you understand
That I'm not your average man
When I got a jammy in my hand
DAAAAAM!!!!! Oooooohh!!
Listen to the way I slaaaaay, your crew
Damage UHH damage UHH damage UHH damage
Destruction, terror, and mayhem
Pass me a sissy so suckas I'll slay him
Farmers (What?!) Farmers (What?!)
I'm ready (We're ready!!)
I think I'm gonna bomb a town (Get down!!)
Don't you never, ever, pull my lever
Cause I explode
And my nine is easy to load
I gotta thank God
Cause He gave me the strength to rock
HARD!! knock you out, mama said knock you out

Sometimes it's hard to tell you so

Its not the first time and it won't be the last.?
Everybody wants a piece of the pie
Its easier now if you justify
Your home is where you make it, You make it where you live
You don?t get what you want and you don?t get what you give
Coffee in the morning is what she would make and
In the afternoon you know we?re feeling the break
You know we?re feeling the break, you know we?re feeling the break
You don?t get what you want but you can get what you take
She loves me now, why wouldn?t she
I love my baby and my baby loves me
She loves me now, because I?m young and able
She loves me for what I bring to the table

I never came to the beach or stood by the ocean
I never sat by the shore under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here, and I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free, as birds catchin' the wind
I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand

The sky's more blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu

[Verse 2]
We watched the sun go down as we were walkin'
I'd spent the rest of my life just standing here talkin'
You would explain the current, as I just smile
Hoping that you'll stay the same and nothing will change
And it'll be us, just for a while
Do they even exist?
That's when I make the wish, to swim away with the fish
Cause it's supposed to be this hot all summer long
I never would've believed you if three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song

The memo says
We gotta work to make the facts fit the false charges
Pull the wool over the eyes of the filthy masses
Stab the people in the back for the corporate choice
Roll the propaganda out using The People's Voice
We don't want to talk about it...

The press scribble scribble every half-truth spoke
Then shoot it round the country like an April Fool's joke
Hype the nation for a Desert Storm love affair
Wave the stars and stripes like you just don't care!

And on the TV screen...
...Diversion and aversion is the flavor of the day
Was it WMDs? Or Democracy?
Blame it on MI-6 or the CIA
The White House Press Corpse only has one thing to say...

""We don't want to talk about it!""

[Verse 4]
The White House boils over, ""Al Jazeera got it wrong!""
The Press Corpse jumps onboard singing the White House song
While over in Iraq thousands are dead because of lies
The spineless war drumming-press corpse have taken lives

I am ready Fantine!

Monsieur, lay down your burden

At the end of my days

You?ve raised my child in love

She?s the best of my life

And you will be with God

Papa, papa, I do not understand
Are you all right?
Why did you go away

Cosette, my child
Am I forgiven now?
Thank God, thank God
I?ve lived to see this day

It?s you who must forgive a thoughtless fool
It?s you who must forgive a thankless man
It?s thanks to you that I am living
And again I lay down my life at your feet
Cosette, your father is a saint
When they wounded me
He took me from the barricade
Carried like a babe
And brought me home
To you

Now you are here
Again beside me
Now I can die in peace
For now my life is blessed

You will live, Papa, you're going to live
It's too soon, too soon to say goodbye!

Yes, Cosette, forbid me now to die
I'll obey
I will try

On this page
I write my last confession
Read it well when I, at last, am sleeping
It's the story
Of one who turned from hating
A man who only learned to love
When you were in his keeping

Come with me
Where chains will never bind you
(Oh, I'm ready, Fantine.)
All your grief
At last, at last behind you
Lord in Heaven
Look down on him in mercy

Forgive me all my trespasses
And take me to your glory

Take my hand
I'll lead you to salvation
Take my love
For love is everlasting
And remember
The truth that once was spoken
To love another person
Is to see the face of God

Do you hear the people sing
Lost in the valley of the night?
It is the music of a people
Who are climbing to the light

For the wretched of the earth
There is a flame that never dies
Even the darkest night will end
And the sun will rise

They will live again in freedom
In the garden of the Lord
We will walk behind the ploughshare;
We will put away the sword
The chain will be broken
And all men will have their reward

Will you join in our crusade?
Who will be strong and stand with me?
Somewhere beyond the barricade
Is there a world you long to see?
Do you hear the people sing?
Say, do you hear the distant drums?
It is the future that they bring
When tomorrow comes!

Millonarios no, billonarios s
Enhorabuena pero dame un segundo
De Madrid a Miami al patio
Juan y el Cata de marcha
No te preocupes y que esto lo disfrutes
Lo dicen en overbooking, read and very looking
Mami olvida y date de lao' con todos esos malaguitas, aaw
Mira que tu eres finita, tu sabes lo que dicen de las finitas, now
Que las ms finitas son las ms .... chiquita
Ah si, que ayer te vi por ah

Rin tin! Tire pa' Madrid
Vamos a liarla vamos a hacerlo ah
Haciendo campa?a para celebrar
Mujeres pa' ti, mujeres pa' mi
Cuando de repente, te veo en la pista
Bailando mi mambo tu linda sonrisa
Apreta DJ sube la bocina pa' que ella lo baile conmigo en la pista
Bailando tu y yo, vamos a recordar
Momentos vacanos que nunca vamos a olvidar

You lit me up
You made me feel as though
I was enough
We danced the night away
We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

[Pre-Chorus]
Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest

[Chorus 1]
I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool
When I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

[Verse 2]
I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee
With a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

[Pre-Chorus 2]
When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

[Chorus 2]
I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling your love is more
Than worth its weight in gold

Now, I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it
?Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow
So I keep conjurin'
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin' will do you wonders
No wonder you're losing your mind, the way it wanders
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo!
I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
?Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
?Cause the very thing that I love's killing me
And I can't conquer it
My OCD is conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the?

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Call me crazy, but I have this vision
One day that I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then, drums get killed and
I'm comin' straight at MC's, blood gets spilled and
I'll take it back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fuckin' children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are going through a struggle feels it
And relates, that's great, it's payback, Russell Wilson
Falling way back in the draft
Turn nothin' into somethin', still can
Make that, straw into gold chump, I will spin
Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straight jacket, face facts
I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
It's nothin', I'm still friends with the?

Hey yo, Doctor, here's another proper track
And it's phat, watch the sniper, time to pay the piper
And let that real shit provoke
See, you's a wannabe 'loc, and you'll get smoked, and I hope
That your fans understand when you talk about sprayin' me
The same records that you makin' is payin' me
Motherfuck Dre! Motherfuck Snoop! Motherfuck Death Row!
Yo, and here comes my left blow
'Cause I'm the E-A-Z-Y-E and this is the season
To let the real motherfuckin' G's in
You're like a kid, you found a pup, and now you're dapper
But tell me, where the fuck you found an anorexic rapper?
Talkin' 'bout who you gon' squabble with and who you shoot
You're only sixty pounds when you're wet and wearin' boots
(Damn, E, they tried to fade you on Dre Day)
But Dre Day only meant Eazy's payday
All of a sudden Dr. Dre is the G Thang
But on his old album cover he was a she-thang
So, nigga please, nigga please
Don't step to these muthaphuckkin' real G's

[Verse 2: Dresta]
Every day it's a new rapper claimin' to be dapper than the Dresta
Softer than a bitch but portray the role of gangsta
Ain't broke a law in your life
Yet every time you rap you yap about the guns and knife
Just take a good look at the nigga and you'll capture
The fact that the bastard is simply just an actor
Who mastered the bang and the slang and the mental
Of niggas in Compton, Watts, and South Central
Never ever once have you ran with the turf
But yet in every verse claim you used to do the dirt
But tell me, who's a witness to your fuckin' work?
So you never had no bid'ness, so save the drama, jerk!
Niggas straight kill me, knowin' that they pranksters
This is goin' out to you studio gangstas
See, I did dirt, put in work, and many niggas can vouch that
So since I got stripes, I got the right to rap about that
But niggas like you, I gotta hate ya
'Cause I'm just tired of suburbia niggas
Talkin' about they come from projects
Knowin' you ain't seen the parts of the streets, G
Think you started tryna bang around the time of the peace treaty
Wearin' khakis and mob while you rhyme
Little fag tried to sag, but you're floodin' at the same time
And your set don't accept ya; scared to kick it with your homies
'Cause you know they don't respect ya
So, nigga please, check nuts
Before you step to these muthaphuckkin' real G's

[Verse 3: B.G. Knocc Out]
Well, it's the Knocc Out, definition ""Original baby gangsta""
Approach me like you hard, motherfucker, I'ma bank ya
Shank ya, with my fuckin' shank, if I have to
Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg are fuckin' actors
Pranksters, studio gangstas, busters
But this time you're dealin' with some real motherfuckers
G's, nigga please, don't try to step
'Cause if you do, then a pealed cap is all that would be left
See, young niggas like me will break you off somethin'
Claimin' my city ? but Dre, you ain't from Compton
Niggas like y'all is what I call wannabes
And ain't shit compared to real muthaphuckkin' G's

[Verse 4: Eazy-E]
I never met a O.G. who never did shit wrong
You tried to diss the Eazy-E, so now, nigga, it's on
You and your Doggy Dogg think that y'all hoggin' shit
Both of you bitches can come and suck my Doggy dick
Beatin' up a bitch don't make you shit, but then again
Some niggas think it makes a man
Damn, it's a trip how a nigga could switch so quick
From wearin' lipstick to smokin' on chronic at picnics
And now you think you're bigger
But to me you ain't nothin' but a bitch-ass nigga
That ain't worth a food stamp
And at Death Row, I hear you gettin' treated like boot camp
Gotta follow your sergeant's directions
Or get your ass pumped with the Smith & Wesson
Learn a lesson from the Eaze
Stay in your place and don't step to real muthaphuckkin' G's

I just left my baby girl a message
Sayin' I won't be coming home
I'd rather be alone
She doesn't fully understand me
Cause I'd rather leave than to cheat
If she gives me some time
I can be the man she needs
But there's a lot of lust inside of me
And we've been together since our teenage years
I really don't mean to hurt her, but I need some time
To be alone

[Hook 1]
But when you love someone
You just don't treat them bad
Oh, how I feel so sad
Now that I wanna leave
She's crying her heart to me
How could you let this be?
I just need time to see
Where I wanna be
Where I wanna be...

Sweet little dee-do-dee-dee...
I don't mean to hurt you, baby, oh, no, no...

[Verse 2]
Never did I imagine
That you would play a major part
In a decision that's so hard
Do I leave, do I stay, do I go?
Or think about my life and what matters to me the most
Girl, the love that we share is real
But in time your heart will heal
I'm not saying I'm gone, but I
Have to find what life is like
Without you

Honey, honey

Can't you see the glow on the window pane?
I can feel the sun whenever you're near
Every time you touch me I just melt away

Silence in the crowd, now to all the men and women

And my mind is proud, but it aches with rage
And if I live too long I'm afraid I'll die

Have you ever met a girl that you tried to date
But a year to make love she wanted you to wait
Let me tell ya a story of my situation
I was talkin' to this girl from the U.S. nation
The way that I met her was on tour at a concert
She had long hair and a short miniskirt
I just got onstage drippin', pourin' with sweat
I was walkin' through the crowd and guess who I met
I whispered in her ear, ""Come to the picture booth
So I can ask you some questions to see if you are a hundred proof""
I asked her her name, she said blah-blah-blah
She had 9/10 pants and a very big bra
I took a couple of flicks and she was enthused
I said, ""How do you like the show?"" She said, ""I was very amused""
I started throwin' bass, she started throwin' back mid-range
But when I sprung the question, she acted kind of strange
Then when I asked, ""Do ya have a man,"" she tried to pretend
She said, ""No I don't, I only have a friend""
Come on
I'm not even goin' for it, this is what I'm goin' sing

[Chorus]
You, you got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend

[Verse 2]
So I took blah-blah's word for it at this time
I thought just havin' a friend couldn't be no crime
'Cause I have friends and that's a fact
Like Agnes, Agatha, Germaine, and Jack
Forget about that, let's go into the story
About a girl named blah-blah-blah that adored me
So we started talkin', getttin' familiar
Spendin' a lot of time so we can build up
A relationship or some understanding
How it's gonna be in the future we was plannin'
Everything sounded so dandy and sweet
I had no idea I was in for a treat
After this was established, everything was cool
The tour was over and she went back to school
I called every day to see how she was doin'
Every time that I called her it seemed somethin' was brewing'
I called her room, a guy picked up, but then I called again
I say, ""Yo, who was that?"" ""Oh, he's just a friend""
Don't gimme that, don't ever gimme that
Jus' bust this

[Chorus]
You, you got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend

[Verse 3]
So I came to her college on a surprise visit
To see my girl that was so exquisite
It was a school day, I knew she was there
The first semester of the school year
I went to a gate to ask where was her dorm
This guy made me fill out a visitor's form
He told me where it was and I was on my way
To see my baby doll, I was happy to say
I arrived in front of the dormitory
""Yo, could you tell me where is door three?""
They showed me where it was for the moment
I didn't know I was in for such an event
So I came to her room and opened the door
Oh, snap! Guess what I saw?
A fella tongue-kissin' my girl in her mouth
I was so in shock my heart went down south
So please listen to the message that I send

Third verse now, gyal, you're clean like a cheddar
Don't too walk out inna sunny weather
Tell your little friend go get herself together
Face white, body black, rasclaat! It's a zebra?
Bleach and salt water no go together
Don't take no boost, don't take no peer pressure
Me no sorry fi you if you nae did a listen
Now your skin look like salt fish pon stretcher
My girl, you might get stretch mark if you rub the gel pon your body too hard
Watch how you paste pon your legs and your arms
If you rub your batty hole and your pussy, wear draws

I just wanna make you feel like everything I ever do
Was never tryna make an issue for you, but I guess the more you
Thought about everything you were never even wrong
In the first place, right? Yeah, I'ma just ignore you
Walking towards you with my head down
Lookin' at the ground, I'm embarrassed for you

How can we keep going at a rate like this?
We can't, so I guess I'ma have to leave
Please, don't come after me

Go ahead, just drink it off
Both know you're gonna call tomorrow like nothing's wrong

Yeah, don't talk down to me
That's not gonna work now
Packed all my clothes and I moved out
I don't even wanna go to your house
Every time I sit on that couch
I feel like you lecture me, eventually, I bet that we
Could have made this work
And prolly woulda figured things out
But I guess I'm a letdown
But it's cool, I checked out
Oh, you wanna be friends now?
Okay, let's put my fake face on and pretend now
Sit around and talk about the good times that didn't even happen

Must have missed that joke, let me see if I can find a reaction
No, but at least you're happy

Stop! It's the motherfucking remix!

[Intro: Mase & (Lil Jon)]
Uhh! Yeah, Harlem is back (TS)
Who in the world want a problem with that? (fo' real)
I heard Harlem is back (You know we had to do the remix)
Who in the world want a problem with that?
(Yeah! Eminem nigga!)
Uhh! Yeah, Harlem is back (Lil Jon nigga!)
Who in the world want a problem with that? (Mason Betha!)
I heard Harlem is back (Fat Joe!)
Who in the world want a problem with that? (Let's go!)

[Hook: Fat Joe]
Said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back
Said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back

[Verse 1: Mase]
You know it's deja vu, and the day y'all do
It'll be the day y'all bleed
Wrist minus 80 degrees
King of Harlem ain't nobody made me leave
Who else could take 5 years off?
Cold turkey? Come back and fly lears off
Cats front leave them leaning like Smirnoff
If haters wanna hate then its their loss
Come up in the Rucker with all my Jake's on
Car grills so big you can cook a steak on
People hear Mase call them wanna get their mase on
You hot 16, I'm a very great song
They beating on the DJ booth 'fore the Mase song
You play Clark Kent, you better have your cape on
Plenty homes Mansion many rooms
My necklace, 2Xs and three Bentley bulls
Lean back, Lean back, Lean back
Cause he's back come on
Lean back, Lean back Lean back
Cause he's back come on

[Lil Jon]
Eminem, what's up! Hey!

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You don't want no problems with Harlem
You don't want no problems with the boogie-down Bronxster
You don't want no drama with the blonde bomber
Original Don Dada of the blonde bottle
The model from White America
Then Joe, the spokesperson for the Latino
Then we got Mase back to re-per-e-sent
E-ver-y-thing else in between
Including the percentages of the rest we don't
The best from each coast, the midwest to the dirty-dirty
Even further to Miami, all the way back to Californ-i-a
It'd probably be best right now if I warn Dre
To get on the horn and tell 'im about the storm coming all our way
So tell a pal, grab a gal right now, get on the floor while I wait
Shake that ass a little more my way, but baby, I don't dance
Not that I can't, there's a pistol in my pants
Come on

Said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back, come on
Said my niggas don't dance

Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back

[Verse 3: Fat Joe]
No Judas or cowardice or Cain's brother
Abel is able to stop me, nigga, not me!
Got the streets asking ""Damn, who can top P?""
Summer Jam? Killed it, man, they did it all with one beat
I guess I'm bi-coastal now
Took a down south brother to bring your boy out (What?!)
As the wheel keeps spinning
I can hear niggas thinking Crack got one hit, then he out
Nope! Joey bring them semi's out
Force you and yours to pour a little Henny out
So much rappers acting in the game
I had to tell them put the mic away
And run and get your Emmy's out
Lean back, motherfuckers
This here's a three peat we back at the Rucker
It's Cook Coke Crack, preach it to ya, brother
The mic more rap and preach you motherfuckers

And say blow your back away, fuck nigga
Lean back, lean back

If you're needing something

At a beautiful angle

And you'll need it most in the dark in the dead of the night

Swimming pool of passion
Mutual attraction
We both know there is something going on
There is something going on
Didn't wanna start this verse with those three little words
'Cause we both know there is something going on
But I don't wanna play it wrong

[Pre-Chorus 1]
So I'm not gonna say it
No, I don't wanna say it
I don't know how you'll take it
So I'mma try not to say it
'Cause when I said it in the past
Each time it didn't last
So I'mma try not to say it
But it feels like I might say it

So I'm putting both hands over my mouth
I can only hope nothing's gonna come out
But there it is on the tip of my tongue

I'm putting both hands over my mouth
I can only hope nothing's gonna come out
But there it is on the tip of my tongue

No big deal explaining how I feel
I don't know why it has taken us so long
Why it's taking us so long
So much hestiation for that kinda conversation
We both know there is something going on now
But we don't wanna play it wrong

Baby you braved it
I understand you had a bad day and shit
So I say something dumb as fuck
And luckily it gives you a facelift
But really I couldn't take it

Chicane in the road

Where to?
Three days in a row my plans fell through
Crying in a hotel room

For real
I would meet you at a certain time
And take my time and make my decision
For real

Think about a time on a dotted line

It ain't a fucking crime for taking back what's mine
Los Angeles, we on the front line

Lining 'em up with a semi-matic auto
Hear the call, hear the call?

When I do it like this
With a wiffle ball bat
Surf's up, bitches, and it's like that
Hollywood coming to attack

In the land of make-believe, the situation's critical
Sink into the ocean like some martyrs at our pinnacle
Yeah, it's just a vision, but the waves are fucking literal
As above, so below
You wanna go to heaven, but you sold your soul
Dying young, I'm growing cold
Cut yourself apart, so you don't grow old

I went down, deep Texas, Mississippi state
Hoping things might go my way
For every hard-earned dollar I make
There stands a white man just to take it away
Some might say I talk loud, see if I care

The back of the club, sippin' Mot is where you'll find me
The back of the club, mackin' hoes, my crew's behind me
Mad question askin', blunt passin'
Music blastin', but I just can't quit
Because one of these honeys Biggie got to creep with
Sleep with, keep the ep a secret, why not?
Why blow up my spot cause we both got hot?
Now check it: I got more mack than Craig, and in the bed
Believe me, sweetie, I got enough to feed the needy
No need to be greedy, I got mad friends with Benzes
C-notes by the layers, true fuckin' players
Jump in the Rover and come over
Tell your friends jump in the GS3, I got the chronic by the tree

[Hook: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I love it when you call me big poppa
Throw your hands in the air if you's a true player
I love it when you call me big poppa
To the honies getting money
Playing niggas like dummies
I love it when you call me big poppa
If you got a gun up in your waist
Please don't shoot up the place!
?Cause I see some ladies tonight
That should be having my baby, baby

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Straight up, honey, really I'm askin'
Most of these niggas think they be mackin', but they be actin'
Who they attractin' with that line
""What's your name? What's your sign?""
Soon as he buy that wine, I just creep up from behind
And ask you what your interests are, who you be with
Things that make you smile, what numbers to dial
You gon' be here for a while?
I'm gon' go call my crew, you go call your crew
We can rendezvous at the bar around 2
Plans to leave, throw the keys to Lil Cease
Pull the truck up front, and roll up the next blunt
So we can steam on the way to the telly, go fill my belly
A T-bone steak, cheese eggs and Welch's grape
Conversate for a few, ?cause in a few we gon' do
What we came to do, ain't that right, boo? (true)
Forget the telly, we just go to the crib
And watch a movie in the jacuzzi, smoke L's while you do me

[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]
(How you living, Biggie Smalls?) In mansions and Benzes
Givin' ends to my friends, and it feels stupendous
Tremendous cream: fuck a dollar and a dream
Still tote gats strapped with infrared beams
Choppin' Os, smokin' la in Optimos
Money, hoes and clothes: all a nigga knows
A foolish pleasure? Whatever
I had to find the buried treasure, so grams I had to measure
However, living better now, Coogi sweater now
Drop top BM's, I'm the man, girlfriend

[Interlude: Puff Daddy]
Yeah, honey, check it?
Tell your friends to get with my friends
And we can be friends
Shit, we can do this every weekend, aight?
Is that aight with you?
Yeah?keep bangin'

And you said it was like fire around the brim
Burning solid, burning thin the burning rim
Like stars burning holes right through the dark
Flicking fire like saltwater into my eyes
You were one inch from the edge of this bed
I drag you back a sleepyhead, sleepyhead

[Verse 2]
They couldn't think of something to say the day you burst
With all their lions and all their might and all their thirst
They crowd your bedroom like some thoughts wearing thin
Against the walls, against your rules, against your skin
My beard grew down to the floor and out through the doors
And of your eyes, begonia skies like a sleepyhead, sleepyhead

A neon cactus in the night

Somewhere underneath them she's there
Never even spoke to her the words of love I held in my heart

Wonder if she's thinking of me
Does she hate me for what I've done
How I wish that I could change everything and go back
Now that my last chance is gone, it's gone

Moon, will you tell her for me
I'm sorry for all the trouble that I've caused
If only I could find a way to return to her someday
For I long to hold her in my arms
But I fear that I'm not for this world
Because I will not go out without a fight
I'm running forever, if they should catch me

When I was younger
I saw my daddy cry and curse at the wind
He broke his own heart and I watched
As he tried to reassemble it
And my mama swore that she would
Never let herself forget
And that was the day that I promised
I'd never sing of love if it does not exist

[Chorus]
But, darling
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

[Verse 2]
Maybe I know, somewhere
Deep in my soul, that love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways
To make it alone, but keep a straight face
And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now, I had sworn to myself
That I'm content with loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk

[Chorus]
Well, you are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

[Bridge]
I've got a tight grip on reality
But I can't, let go of what's in front of me here
I know you're leaving in the morning, when you wake up
Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream

[Chorus]
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

I thought I knew a way to be
But I'm not right here
Feeling out on a limb
Because I'm out of my mind
But it's fine

[Verse 2]
I've had a lot of time alone, disintegrating
Watching all of the hours with a bottle of wine
What a line

[Verse 3]
I couldn't see a way to go
Obscured by feeling
Just a body alive ignoring all of the signs
That it's time

To make a repair of surroundings
To take a car out to the sea
With nothing there but me and shadows
And in nothing I believe

[Hook]
And now the lights are turning on here
A mind has fallen
And taken everything it knows now
About belonging
There's someone I would like to be if I could be but
The path is frightening
So when I find a way that I would like to see
I enter entirely

[Verse 5]
My world looks like I had only dreamed
Cutting up pieces of life and reality
I thought I knew what I could be
And now I'm there
And when I think about the time
I start to see her there

[Verse 1: Cardi B]
I think us bad bitches is a gift from God (gift from God)
I think you broke hoes need to get a job (get a job)
Now I'm a boss, I write my own name on the checks (Cardi)
Pussy so good, I say my own name during sex
I might smack a bitch 'cause I felt like it
Gucci shoes and a belt like it
Said that Cardi is his favorite fragrance
I'm a rich bitch and I smell like it
I'm in a boss bitch mood, ay, these heels are Givenchy, ho
These are some boss bitch shoes
If you ain't no boss bitch, move, ay
For the record, I set record record sales
I like niggas that been in and outta jail
They said by now that I'll be finished, hard to tell (I can tell)
My little 15 minutes lasting long as hell, huh?

Look, broke hoes do what they can (can)
Good girls do what they told (told)
Bad bitches do what they want (they want)
That's why a bitch is so cold
I'm a gangsta in a dress, I'm a bully in the bed
Only time that I'm a lady's when I lay these hoes to rest
The coupe is roofless, but I get top in it
I'm provocative, it's my prerogative
80K just to know what time is it
Cardi rockin' it, go buy stock in it
Spent what I want, ain't no limit
I say what I want, I ain't never been timid
Only real shit comes out my mouth and only real niggas go in it
Leave his texts on read, leave his balls on blue
Put it on airplane mode so none of those calls come through
Here's a word to my ladies, don't you give these niggas none (give 'em none)
If they can make you richer, they can make you cum

She came from Greece, she had a thirst for knowledge
She studied sculpture at Saint Martin's College
That's where I caught her eye
She told me that her Dad was loaded
I said ""In that case I'll have rum and coca-cola
She said ""fine""
And then in thirty seconds time she said

[Chorus 1]
""I want to live like common people
I want to do whatever common people do
I want to sleep with common people
I want to sleep with common people like you""
Well what else could I do?
I said ""I'll see what I can do""

[Verse 2]
I took her to a supermarket
I don't know why
But I had to start it somewhere
So it started there
I said ""pretend you've got no money""
But she just laughed
And said ""oh you're so funny""
I said ""Yeah
Well I can't see anyone else smiling in here
Are you sure

[Chorus 2]
You want to live like common people
You want to see whatever common people see
You want to sleep with common people
You want to sleep with common people like me??
But she didn?t understand
She just smiled and held my hand

[Bridge]
Rent a flat above a shop
Cut your hair and get a job
Smoke some fags and play some pool
Pretend you never went to school
But still you'll never get it right
Cause when you're laid in bed at night
Watching roaches climb the wall
If you called your dad he could stop it all
Yeah

[Chorus 3]
You'll never live like common people
You'll never do what common people do
You'll never fail like common people
You'll never watch your life slide out of view
And we dance, and drink, and screw
Because there's nothing else to do

[Chorus 4]
Sing along with the common people
Sing along and it might just get you through
Laugh along with the common people
Laugh along, even though they're laughing at you
And the stupid things that you do
Because you think that poor is cool

[Verse 4]
Like a dog lying in a corner
They will bite you and never warn you
Look out
They'll tear your insides out
Cause everybody hates a tourist
Especially one who thinks
It's all such a laugh
Yeah and the chip stain's grease
Will come out in the bath
You will never understand
How it feels to live your life
With no meaning or control
And with nowhere left to go
You are amazed that they exist
And they burn so bright
Whilst you can only wonder why

[Bridge]
Rent a flat above a shop
Cut your hair and get a job
Smoke some fags and play some pool
Pretend you never went to school
But still you'll never get it right

Watching roaches climb the wall
If you called your dad he could stop it all
Yeah

Never do what common people do
Never fail like common people
Never watch your life slide out of view

When you see J3T thirty deep, he's down to brawl
Fuck the haters I see, 'cause I hate that you breathe
I see you duck, you little punk, you little fucking disease

How fucking stupid and foolish of you to think you can do this
You cowards can't, you never will, don't even try to pursue it
I took the chance, I paid the bill, I nearly died for this music
You make me wanna run around pulling my guns out and shit
You're tempting me to run my mouth and call you out on this, bitch
How ignorant you gotta be to believe any of this?
You need to slit your wrists, get pissed, and go jump off a bridge
What, you can't see the sarcasm in the verses I spit?
What, you think I just got lucky, didn't work for this shit?
Bitch, I've been working at this ever since I was a kid
I've played a million empty shows to only family and friends
What kind of person would diss a band that deserves to get big?
I'd hate to be that person when my verse comes out their kid's lips

Because there's nothing in my life except my dick and what I spit
So my dick is in my hand when I respond to faggots talking shit
Speaking of fag, already rapped with the drag
We killed him then we stuffed his body in the Cadillac
B-But you always press and you know I never stress
With Loki DMS, J-Johnny to my left
Got Phantom and the rest who are down to rep the west
I grew up on drive-bys and LA gang signs
So what the fuck you know about being a gangster?
And what the fuck you know about being in danger?
You ain't doing this so you know you're just talking shit

If I said fuck you I meant that
I'm whippin' this coupe, I ain't rent that
The shit that you savin', I spent that
And if you want smoke you can get that
I just want proof of the backend
Any time I fuck her I hit from the back end
I'm pullin' her hair while I dig in her
She like hold up baby, keep my tracts in
I can't hit that bitch raw, got a glove on me
I'm in the trap with the drugs on me

I just wanna, I just wanna
I just wanna, I just wanna
I just wanna, I just wanna paint the town
I don't wanna hide my love
I just wanna hold your hand and be the one that you think of
When you need a holiday, when you wanna drink ros
I just wanna paint your toes and in the morning kiss your nose
Cause when I'm with you I don't feel afraid
Maybe this love will indoctrinate
I echo every word that you say
The way you feel, yeah I feel the same way
Remember the night when I combed your hair
I hope I didn't freak you out when I stared
I donate my truth to you like I'm rich
The truth is love ain't got no off switch
So if the walls come tumbling down
And if the ocean really does drown
And if my memories never come back
I'll still remember when we were first was naked at
Picture our faces and new oasis
When we made love we left many traces
Just like the blush thats on your cheeks
Deep inside we're all just Pynk

You spend your nights alone
And he never comes home
And every time you call him
All you get's a busy tone
I heard you found out
That he's doin' to you what you did to me
Ain't that the way it goes
When you cheated, girl
My heart bleeded, girl
So it goes without sayin' that you left me feelin' hurt
Just a classic case, a scenario
Tale as old as time
Girl, you got what you deserved

Silver gray hair neatly combed in place
There were four generations of love on her face
She was so wise, no surprise passed her eyes
She'd seen it all

I was a child, oh, about three or four
All day I'd ask questions
At night I'd ask more
But whenever; she never, would ever, turn me away

I'd say how can I be sure what is right or wrong ?
And why does what I want always take so long ?
Please tell me where does God live
And why won't He talk to me ?

I'd say, Grandma what is love ?
Will I ever find out ?
Why are we so poor, what is life about ?
I wanna know the answers before I fall off to sleep

She sort of smiled as she tucked me in
Then she pulled up that old rockin' chair once again
But tonight she was slightly, remarkably
Different somehow

Slowly she rocked, lookin' half asleep
Grandma yawned as she stretched
Then she started to speak
What she told me, would mold me, and hold me
Together inside

She said all the things you ask
You will know someday
But you have got to live in a patient way
God put us here by fate
And by fate that means better days

She said, child we are all moons in the dark of night
Ain't no morning gonna come 'til the time is right
Can't get to better days lest you make it through the night
You gotta make it through the night, yes you do

You can't get to no better days
Unless you make it through the night
Oh, you will see those better days
But you gotta be patient
(Be patient) oh baby, be patient

Later that year, at the turn of spring
Heaven sent angels down and gave Grandma her wings
Now, she's flying, and sliding, and gliding
In better days

And although I'm all grown up
I still get confused
I stumble through the dark
Getting bumped and bruised
When night gets in my way
I could still hear my Grandma say
I can hear her say
I can hear her say

(Be patient) You can't get to no better days
Unless you make it through the night baby
(Be patient) Oh, you will see those better days
But you gotta be patient
Child, do you hear me, yeah

(Be patient) You can't get to no better days
Unless you make it, you got to make it
You got to make it
You got to make it through the night

(Be patient) Oh Grandma, oh Grandma
Do you see me now, lady
Oh oh oh oh oh...

(Be patient) She used to sit me on her knee

Para vos, gato
Al final yo tenia razn, me decias mentiras mi amor
Me sarpaste bien el corazn

Y a ella la llevaste a nuestra habitacin
La besaste junto a nuestra foto de Europa
Y le diste masa en mi colchn
Y ahora las ma?anas ya no son las ma?anas
Ya no tienes mi presencia que sana
Me parece a mi o a ti te quedo fra la cama?
Que garron, te fuiste de mi casa sin pedir perdn
Ahora mis amigos te dicen traizon porque me rompiste el corazn
Y ahora queres volver
Pero tomate el palo, y ahora tomatelo
Y ahora tomate el palo, y ahora tomatelo

Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby

[Verse 1]
Such a sexy, sexy pretty little thing
Fierce nipple pierce, you got me sprung with your tongue ring
And I ain't gonna lie 'cause your loving gets me high
So to keep you by my side, there's nothing that I won't try
Butterflies in her eyes and looks to kill
Time is passin', I'm askin', ""Could this be real?""
'Cause I can't sleep, I can't hold still
The only thing I really know is she got sex appeal
I can feel, too much is never enough
You're always there to lift me up when these times get rough
I was lost, now I'm found ever since you've been around
You're the women that I want, so yo, I'm puttin' it down

[Hook]
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy

[Verse 2]
I don't deserve you unless it's some kind of hidden message
To show me life is precious, then I guess it's true
But to tell truth, I really never knew 'til I met you
See I was lost and confused, twisted and used up
Knew a better life existed, but thought that I missed it
My lifestyle's wild, I was livin' like a wild child
Trapped on a short leash paroled the police files
So yo, what's happenin' now?
I see the sun breakin' down into dark clouds
And a vision of you standin' out in a crowd, so

[Hook]
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy

[Verse 3]
Hey sugar mama, come and dance with me
The smartest thing you ever did was take a chance with me
Whatever tickles your fancy
Girl, it's me and you like Sid and Nancy
So sexy, almost evil
Talkin' 'bout butterflies in my head
I used to think that happy endings were only in the books I read
But you made me feel alive when I was almost dead
You filled that empty space with the love I used to chase
And as far as I can see it don't get better than this
So butterfly, here is a song and it's sealed with a kiss
And a thank you, miss

Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
So come and dance with me
Uh huh, uh huh

We caught him slippin', he in a coma
You got two choices, lose your life or your persona
I still hear voices from them nights I hit them corners
Walked through the MoMA, just did a feature, hit Cassina
Blew the quota, I might do Toshiyuki Kita for the sofa
Might save my Nike check and spend my Coca-Cola
Don't count my pockets, pocket rocket leave you tore up
Time to glow up, from the floor up how I came
You don't know my pain, bitch, don't act like you don't know my name
Don't record me man, bitch, you see me tryna board this plane
Don't you touch my frame, still the one who bust you in your brain
I don't fuck with fame, you don't see me in no fuckin' chains
Ain't no fuckin' slave, Def Jam ain't gon' put me on no blade

Baby what's on your mind
When you see me pull up in your drive?

Maybe have a little high dollar wine?

Trust
Pick up the phone, show me it was real
Pick up the phone, show me it was real
Pick up the phone, show me it was real
Pick up the phone

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, I don't wanna put no pressure on ya
I just wanna put a blessing on ya
Since our last undressin' session
I'm not really sure if you've been checkin'
I'm progressin', I just heard my songs
Is poppin' out in Macedonia
And even Serbia, I don't mean to burden ya
If you got a man since then, I understand
Last thing I wanna do is get you jammed
'Specially if he's a fan
He'll prolly never wanna hear my shit again
And I need every single SoundScan
But if you single and you down, then...
I'm in your town fiendin' for another round
I was countin' down the days
Been more patient than a Browns fan
Where that chip at?
Prolly on your shoulder, 'cause I forgot to hit back
Left you on read, apologies are said
But often never meant, well fuck that, I repent
For message never sent, now...

[Verse 2: Miguel]
Hello, stranger
It's been a minute since we last kicked it
And by the way, just got in town
And I won't let cumulus clouds all in the sky ruin my vibe
Usually, I don't do this often
But since recruiting isn't an option
Due to unusual rain and thunder
Baby, I wonder, baby, I wonder, would you just

[Pre-Chorus: Miguel]
Put your sweats on, put your sweats on for me, yeah
'Cause I got the plug, I made the call for green
I'm talkin' late-night for you
Let me lay a great time on you
Don't hesitate, no, don't you, no, no

[Chorus: Miguel]
Just say you will, will, will
Come through and chill, chill, chill
Just say you will, will, will
Come through and chill, chill, chill
Mmm say it

I wanna f... all night (say it)
I wanna f... all night (uh-huh, uh-huh)
I wanna f... all night (say it)
I wanna f... all night

[Verse 3: Miguel]
Hello, stranger, vape's been waiting
And just as I recall, that ass is still amazing
I'm playin', baby; nah I'm sayin', baby
Lovin' shit, you know I'm crazy
So go ahead and pour the drink up
I'm so glad we got to link up, uh yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Miguel]
Get to takin' that off, takin' that off for me, yeah yeah
'Cause I got the plug, I made the call for green
I'm talkin' late-night for you

She hit back, shit that's a good sign... yeah
Come through and chill, chill, chill
Ayy, Gucc, can I tell her some real shit? Yeah

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
In case my lack of reply had you catchin' them feelings
Know you've been on my mind like Kaepernick kneelin'
Or police killings, or Trump sayin' slick shit
Manipulatin' poor white folks because they ignant
Blind to the struggles of the ones that got the pigment
Lately I've been stressin' 'cause it seems so malignant
I need to feel your essence in my presence if you're with it
I guarantee you won't regret you did it if you come through

[Chorus: Miguel]
Just say you will, will, will
Come through and chill, chill, chill
Just say you will, will, will
Come through and chill, chill, chill
Just say you will, will, will

I needed you to say it wasn?t one to rue

Wipers clicking and my thoughts they followed suit

Guess they were illusions of a man who dreamed too big

On your mark ready set let's go, dance floor pro
I know you know I go psycho
When my new joint hit, just can't sit
Got to get jiggy with it, ooh, that's it
Now honey honey come ride, DKNY
All up in my eye, you got a Prada
Bag with a lot of stuff in it
Give it to your friend let's spin, everybody looking at me
Glancing the kid, wishing they was dancing a jig
Here with this handsome kid, ciga-cigar
Right from Cuba-Cuba, I just bite it
It's for the look, I don't light it
Illway the an-may on the ance-day oor-flay
Give it up jiggy make it feel like foreplay
Yo my cardio is infinite, ha-ha
Big Willie style's all in it, getting jiggy with it

[Verse 2]
What you want to ball with the kid?
Watch your step you might fall
Trying to do what I did
Mama mama mama come closer
In the middle of the club with the rub-a-dub
No love for the haters, the haters
Mad cause I got floor seats at the Lakers
See me on the fifty yard line with the Raiders
Met Ali he told me I'm the greatest
I got the fever for the flavor of a crowd-pleaser
DJ play another from the prince of this
Your highness, only mad chicks ride in my whips
South to the West to the East to the North
Bought my hits and watch them go off a go off
Ah, yes-yes y'all
Ya don't stop in the winter or the (Summertime)
I makes it hot, getting jiggy with 'em

Eight-fifty I.S. if you need a lift
Who's the kid in the drop? Who else Will Smith
Living that life some consider a myth
Rock from south street to one two fifth
Women used to tease me, give it to me now nice and easy
Since I moved up like George and Weezie
Cream to the maximum I be asking 'em
Would you like to bounce with the brother that's platinum?
Never see Will attacking 'em
Rather play ball with Shaq and 'em, flatten 'em
Psych, kidding
Thought I took a spill but I didn't
Trust the lady of my life she hitting
Hit her with a drop top with the ribbon
Crib for my mom on the outskirts of Philly
You trying to flex on me?
Don't be silly, getting jiggy with it

When my wrist flash
My girl hop out she look explosive
Catfish bitch, your girl don't take no close-ups
I got B.I.G grass nigga
Yellow bih like cab nigga
Goin' up under no cap
I rent coupe then slack
Hit a big lick then dip
Had to up that off my hip
Left ol' girl on read
Ain't text back now she big sick
I know that they prayed on my demise
Hatin' nigga, I see all that bullshit in your eyes, yeah, yeah
Tell 'em what they want, you tell 'em lies

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Oh they big mad
They'd rather see me doin' bad, back on Second Ave
They'd rather see me in a Honda instead of this Turbo Porsche
I came a long way from McDonald's to this five course
I got 'em so B.I.G, M.A.D, they envy us
I'm gettin' money to these haters I'm oblivious
We got the draco, with extendo, keep a pick on us
Is he dumb? Is he stupid?
He an idiot
My slime Reese hit me up
You know I'm pullin' up
It got 'em big mad, big mad
Back to back the Bentley trucks
Got 'em big mad I could tell we still don't give no fuck
Got 'em big mad Mr. 424 with Saint Laurent

And I can?t wait for such and such to be released
I know all your shooters vegan they don't want no beef
They don't want no smoke, big Glock I tote (blah, blah, blah)
Money dance on that cash, just last year I was broke
Size a nigga up, yeah he get tailored
And my bitch told me to stop doin' these lil broke ass niggas favors
A lot of niggas say I?m lucky I?m just blessed and highly favored

Set an open course for the Virgin Sea
'Cause I've got to be free

We'll search for tomorrow on every shore

Reflections in the waves spark my memory
Some happy, some sad

But somehow we missed out on the pot of gold
But we'll try best that we can, to carry on

It seems like only yesterday
I gazed through the glass
At ramblers, wild gamblers
That's all in the past

You call me a fool
You say it's a crazy scheme
This one's for real
I already bought the dream
So useless to ask me why
Throw a kiss and say goodbye
I'll make it this time
I'm ready to cross that fine line

[Chorus]
I'll learn to work the saxophone
I'll play just what I feel
Drink Scotch whisky all night long
And die behind the wheel
They got a name for the winners in the world
I want a name when I lose
They call Alabama the Crimson Tide
Call me Deacon Blues

[Verse 2]
My back to the wall
A victim of laughing chance
This is for me
The essence of true romance
Sharing the things we know and love
With those of my kind
Libations, sensations
That stagger the mind

I crawl like a viper
Through these suburban streets
Make love to these women
Languid and bittersweet
I'll rise when the sun goes down
Cover every game in town
A world of my own
I'll make it my home sweet home

[Chorus]
I'll learn to work the saxophone
I'll play just what I feel
Drink Scotch whisky all night long
And die behind the wheel
They got a name for the winners in the world
I want a name when I lose
They call Alabama the Crimson Tide
Call me Deacon Blues

[Verse 3]
This is the night
Of the expanding man
I take one last drag
As I approach the stand
I cried when I wrote this song
Sue me if I play too long
This brother is free
I'll be what I want to be

With mass body I was built to last
Any opponent who want it will get a fuckin blast
Bomb verse and the core is nails and broken glass

Break MCs ligaments and the I sign the cast

Lemme ask you something
Are you content wit content
Be honest, this music has its consiquence
What you preach what you teach in our conscience
Is constant
Global, we're big in every continent
This is hip hop
A culture corrupt
We blame the industry when really tho the culprit is us
Afraid to speak up
Even the most powerful are cowards too
Dumb enough to see that its the labels we give power to
Where ya loyalty at
If I was you, I would go and give my royalties back
Im talkin
Back to community its you and me emcees against the world
As it's usually
Im just tryna reach out to these kids wit my music
And pick em up like truency
Lift em up spiritually
Give em some immunity
Im from the street, you can't teach success
You gotta earn it, won't make it as a teachers pet

Try get my skin golden like the girls you like

And I can't stop dreaming

[Verse 2]
Yeah
Sometimes I just start to forget it
I let it fade out for a second
And then it comes back and it's a whirlwind
Tearing up inside of me
I never succeed to explain it
The words, they escape me in it
Never ever leaving what was long ago planted in my brain
It stays, it just

Waiting for my conscience calling
Listening to hear me talking
Slowing down the rate of motion
Focusing inside an ocean
Catching myself falling over
Looking backwards seeing no one

And I can't stop dreaming
And I can't stop dreaming

All the changes but still every things the same
There's this world that can't withstain
So there's a purpose in our pain
It's calling me inside my heart from whence I came
Looking down over my shoulder
I feel it falling down again, like I'm just

All I need is 'bout a hour, better yet maybe two

When I whisper in your ear, your legs hit the chandelier
Passion fruit and sex all in the atmosphere

What a brother gonna do when the bitty rolls through
Who's lookin' just like Jada, we hit the elevator

""A deep snow, was on the ground in Washington..""

[Dred Scott]
Too slick; I pick a pocket even when it's under lock and key
Most definitely got the flow so let me shoplift the show
From under, the nose of the mediocre joker
For the mic last week, yeah I was fiendin like a smoker
On my way to the mall, yo what's the plan I can't call it
He said, ""How much ya got?"" I'm pullin the lint out my wallet
I said, ""Nobody's home,"" he's lookin kinda funny
Realizin that I hadn't planned on spendin any money
Seen a brand new au-dio Technic, a cordless mic
He said, ""You know we can't afford this,"" syke
I accidentally picked it up, it accidentally fell in my pocket
Whaddya know? I accidentally walked out the store
Alarm went off, my knees were sore
Security woulda been any second so we fled North
Like runaway slaves to the parkin lot
Got in the car, turned the key, but my shit wouldn't start

[Hook]
So duck ya head they're rollin by, they're rollin by
Ya gots to duck ya head they're rollin by, they're rollin by

[Dred Scott]
And while patrol was on the lookout for two crooks
A-outta the car we snuck into the back of a truck and we was GONE..
Word is bond.. {*harmonizing*}
.. AIYYO!
We made the getaway quick, I'm thinkin glory hallelujah
The brother too slick a-but the story wasn't through
You had to understand what was goin on inside my brain
Now I had a hunger pain so I had to run my game
At the local diner, where all of the honies rolled through yo
Ordered everything we saw on the menu
And you know damn well I couldn't afford what I ate
Next thing you know yo, ""THERE'S A ROACH ON THE PLATE!""
Brother made a scene, carried out the scheme
Fronted on the waiter and refused to pay the fee, later B
I had to make a phone call
To ask Big Moe to get my car from the mall
And he would have to give it a jump start cause yo I couldn't risk it
Next thing you know we're on the Boulevard in Linden
No no no, not a row but if I done ya ho
Went to the head and with the big bottle of rum
Goin straight to the brain cell the alcohol arrived
Huh, avoided accidentally made a drunk driver
To the local vocal joint, where the brothers flow yo
We stumbled in and plugged the mic in, and you know
That I had (??) what me I'm on it
Say you're flowin it with the funk and yo you oughta turn the page
And see the crowd gettin pumped, now the jealous wanna riff
I felt the rum comin through me, so I had to take a piss
In the bathroom, about to button up my fly
Stick up kids, they out the corner of the eye
Turned to my jacket, like I was packin
For this three on one so you see the odds stackin up
Against me, up against the wall they fenced me
With their backs to the door, so you know that they could not see
Big Mo with Domino bust in
And now it's Even Steven, three on three, so we rushed dem

[Hook]
So duck ya head we're comin in, we're comin in
Ya gots to duck ya head we're comin in, we're comin in
Ya gots to duck ya head we're comin in, we're comin in
Ya gots to duck ya head we're comin in, we're comin in

[Dred Scott]
AND, to make sure they wouldn't try that again
Hit one in the head with a bottle of gin
Seen the next one reach to go inside the coat
I put my knee into the groin the elbow to the throat
It happened so fast you couldn't think
Hit the head of the third on the edge of the sink
And after he fell out in my mind I had no doubt
Took the wallets and the jewelry and we broke the hell out
Leavin the scene of the crime, headed for home sweet home
When the thought crossed my mind that I had left my microphone
And me without a mic is like a brother with no function
That's like (?) cop without the greed and the corruption
And the crooked politician I was on my own mission
He said, ""Ya can't go back,"" but would I listen?
I (?) in the facility at half past three
Pullin up to the stoplight and who do we see?
Stick up kids, they ten deep, rollin the other way
Inside my head, I heard a little bitty voice say

[Hook]
Duck ya head they're rollin by, they're rollin by
Ya gots to duck ya head they're rollin..

[Dred Scott]
.. but I guess I wasn't duckin low enough
The jig was up, I floored the pedal on the ass
The stick up kids they had a score to settle
The shot-glass the broken glass and there goes the back window
And with it went a very large piece of my shoulder
My grill went into shock as I felt the car swerve
About to get served on the choppin block
A ring-a-ding-a-ling-a-ling alarm clock, wake up we gotta jet
Says my brother, I lay in the bed in a cold sweat
Covered in my piss, a minor technicality
Better to learn from this than to fuck with some reality
Thinkin educatin over like a fat rat
You'll always get caught in your own mousetrap

[Hook]
So duck ya head they're rollin by, they're rollin by
Ya gots to duck ya head they're rollin by, they're rollin by
Ya gots to duck ya head they're rollin by, they're rollin by
Ya gots to duck ya head they're rollin by, they're rollin by

[Dred Scott]
To the beat y'all duck it
On the microphone gots to duck it, pluck it, duck it, pluckin
Like a chicken when I'm kickin what I'm stickin in ya ear
More rhymes that you need to hear
You find that I come off like this at the end with the beat
Drop everything now you know that sounds sweet

Since the Prehistoric ages and the days of ancient Greece
Right down through the Middle Ages, planet Earth kept going through changes
And then no renaissance came, and times continued to change

They were Renegades of their time and age

We're the Renegades of FUNK!!

We're teachers of the funk and not of empty popping
We're blessed with the force and the sight of electronics
With the bass, and the treble, the horns, and our vocals
Cause everytime I pop into the beat, we get FRESH!!

[*drum break*]

C'MON!!
[Guitar riff]

C'MON! There was a time when our music
Was something called ""The Bay Street"" beat
People would gather from all around
To get down to the big sound
You had to be a Renegade in those days..
To take a man to the dance floor..

But I'm still here and it's clear I've gotta win this war

[Verse 1]
I can see the storms, in her eyes now
I'm falling overboard, in the waves
In over my head and she's a high tide
That keeps pushing me away
I thought that we would build this together
But everything I touch just seems to break
Am I your sail or your anchor?
Am I the calm or the hurricane?
I feel the ground start to shake
I hear a voice shouting, ""No!""
But there is no fucking way I'd leave you

[Chorus]
So I'll just hold you like a hand grenade
You touch me like a razor blade
I wish there was some other way right now
Like a house on fire we're wrapped in flames
I'd burn you if that's what it takes
To let you know I won't let go of you

[Verse 2]
But is the soundtrack to our lives
The bang of a slamming door?
What happens when we all start to feel like
Nothing matters anymore?
Every day like a chambered round
A trigger pulled, a hammer click
A breath we hold, a world outside I can't control
No matter what I do

[Chorus]
So I'll just hold you like a hand grenade
You touch me like a razor blade
I wish there was some other way right now
Like a house on fire we're wrapped in flames
I'd burn you if that's what it takes
To let you know I won't let go of you

[Verse 3]
And how is it a thing?
That we just wanna hurt each other
I'm waiting on for rain
Feels like is gonna rain forever
Someday you will learn
That all I ever did was for you
And I would do it all again
I would do it all again

Hypnotic, funky fresh
Work my body, so melodic
This beat rolls right through my chest
Everybody, Ma and Papi
Came to party, grab somebody
Work ya body, work ya body
Let me see you one, two step

[Chorus: Ciara]
Rock it, don't stop it
Everybody get on the floor
Crank the party up
We about to get it on
Let me see you one, two step
I love it when you one, two step
Everybody one, two step
We about to get it on (This beat is...)

[Verse 2: Ciara (Missy Elliott)]
Outrageous, so contagious
Make you crave it (Jazze made it!)
So retarded, top-charted
Ever since the day I started
Strut my stuff and yes, I flaunt it
Goodies make the boys jump on it
No, I can't control myself
Now let me do my one, two step

[Chorus: Ciara]
Rock it, don't stop it
Everybody get on the floor
Crank the party up
We about to get it on
Let me see you one, two step
I love it when you one, two step
Everybody one, two step
We about to get it on

[Spoken: Missy Elliott]
We gon' flip it like this

[Bridge: Ciara]
It don't matter to me, we can dance slow
Whichever way the beat drop, our bodies will flow
So swing it over here Mr. DJ
And we will, we will, rock you
It don't matter to me, we can dance slow
Whichever way the beat drop our bodies will go
So swing it over here Mr. DJ
And we will, we will, rock you

[Breakdown: Missy Elliott]
I shake it like Jello, make the boys say hello
'Cause they know I'm rockin' the beat
I know you heard about a lot of great MC's
But they ain't got nothin' on me
Because I'm 5 foot 2, I wanna dance with you
And I'm sophistcated fun
I eat filet mignon and I'm nice and young
Best believe I'm number one

[Chorus: Ciara]
Rock it, don't stop it
Everybody get on the floor
Crank the party up
We about to get it on
Let me see you one, two step
I love it when you one, two step
Everybody one, two step

Were you mad then
With nothing left to do?

We wouldn't let this come between everything
And is it true that I could look past
Memories and stay obscene?

Everything you want in life
Because you never put in effort, and the truth is
You were never doing it right

On the front lobe of my left side brains

Four letter word just to get me along
It's a difficulty and I'm biting on my tongue
And I, I keep stalling, not keeping me together

Holding back, every day the same

I never say anything at all
So with nothing to consider, they forget my name

They call me her
They call me Jane

I'm the last drip standing up against the wall

Lock myself away, listen to me, I'm not

I cannot emphasize

And you cry some of the hottest tears you ever cried
Multiplied by five

I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
Oh God it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you
That forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head

?Cause I?m looking at you through the glass
Don?t know how much time has passed
All I know is that it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you
That forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head

[Verse 1]
How do you feel? That is the question
But I forget you don't expect an easy answer
When something like a soul becomes initialized and folded up
Like paper dolls and little notes, you can?t expect a bit of hope

[Pre-Chorus 1]
So while you?re outside looking in, describing what you see
Remember what you?re staring at is me

[Chorus]
?Cause I?m looking at you through the glass
Don?t know how much time has passed
All I know is that it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you
That forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head

[Verse 2]
How much is real? So much to question
An epidemic of the mannequins, contaminating everything
We thought came from the heart, but never did right from the start
Just listen to the noises, null and void instead of voices

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Before you tell yourself, it's just a different scene
Remember it's just different from what you've seen

[Chorus]
I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
And all I know is that it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you
That forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head

'Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
And all I know is that it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you
That forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head

Let's take our time tonight, girl
Above us all the stars are watchin'

While I kiss your neck and shoulders
No, don't be afraid to show it all

Your head down to your heels
Don't be confused by my smile

Leaves are falling all around, It's time I was on my way
Thanks to you, I'm much obliged for such a pleasant stay
But now it's time for me to go, the autumn moon lights my way
For now I smell the rain, and with it pain, and it's headed my way
Ah, sometimes I grow so tired
But I know I've got one thing I got to do

[Chorus]
Ramble on
And now's the time, the time is now
To sing my song
I'm going around the world, I got to find my girl
On my way
I've been this way ten years to the day
Ramble on
Gotta find the queen of all my dreams

Got no time to for spreading roots
The time has come to be gone
And though ""Our health"" we drank a thousand times
It's time to ramble on

To sing my song

I gotta find the queen of all my dreams

I tell you no lie

[Verse 3]
Mine's a tale that can't be told, my freedom I hold dear
How years ago in days of old, when magic filled the air
'Twas in the darkest depths of Mordor, I met a girl so fair
But Gollum, and the evil one
Crept up and slipped away with her, her, her, yeah
Ah, there's nothing I can do now
I guess I'll keep on
